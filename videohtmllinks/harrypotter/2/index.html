1
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:15,201
I can't let you out, Hedwig.

2
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:18,913
I'm not allowed to use magic
outside of school.

3
00:01:19,372 --> 00:01:23,293
- Besides, if Uncle Vernon--
- Harry Potter!

4
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:26,713
Now you've done it.

5
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:34,220
He's in there. Vernon?

6
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:40,351
I'm warning you, if you can't control
that bloody bird, it'll have to go.

7
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,353
But she's bored.

8
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,025
If I could only let her out
for an hour or two.

9
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:51,112
So you can send secret messages
to your freaky little friends? No, sir.

10
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:56,409
But I haven't had any messages
from any of my friends.

11
00:01:56,576 --> 00:01:58,244
Not one...

12
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:00,121
...all summer.

13
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,541
Who would want to be friends with you?

14
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:08,254
I should think you'd be
a little more grateful.

15
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:11,924
We've raised you since you were a baby,
given you the food off our table...

16
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:14,218
...even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom...

17
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:16,929
...purely out of the goodness
of our hearts.

18
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,599
Not now.
It's for when the Masons arrive.

19
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:23,102
Which should be any minute.

20
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,606
Now, let's go over our schedule
once again, shall we?

21
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:28,733
Petunia, when the Masons arrive,
you will be...?

22
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,570
In the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

23
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:36,658
- Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
- I'll be waiting to open the door.

24
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:38,743
Excellent.

25
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:45,124
And you?

26
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,088
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise
and pretending that I don't exist.

27
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,964
Too right, you will.

28
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:55,635
With any luck, this could be the day
I make the biggest deal of my career...

29
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:59,389
...and you will not mess it up.

30
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:15,321
Harry Potter, such an honor it is.

31
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:23,121
- Who are you?
- Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.

32
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:25,206
Not to be rude or anything...

33
00:03:25,415 --> 00:03:29,335
...but this isn't a great time for me
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.

34
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:32,004
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.

35
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:35,299
It's just that Dobby
has come to tell you...

36
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:40,304
It is difficult, sir.
Dobby wonders where to begin.

37
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:46,310
- Why don't you sit down?
- Sit down? Sit down?

38
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:54,026
Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to offend you or anything.

39
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,362
Offend Dobby?

40
00:03:56,529 --> 00:03:58,865
Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir...

41
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:04,829
...but never has he been asked
to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.

42
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:08,374
You can't have met
many decent wizards then.

43
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:11,002
No, I haven't.

44
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,880
That was an awful thing to say.

45
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:18,009
- Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
- Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.

46
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,552
Dobby, please, stop.

47
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,684
Don't mind that. It's just the cat.

48
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:33,191
- Bad Dobby.
- Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.

49
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:35,610
Are you all right?

50
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,238
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.

51
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:42,617
Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir.

52
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:46,746
- Your family?
- The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.

53
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:49,916
Dobby is bound to serve one family forever.

54
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,627
If they ever knew Dobby was here...

55
00:04:54,253 --> 00:05:00,051
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.

56
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:02,553
Harry Potter must not go back...

57
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,391
...to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.

58
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:12,730
There is a plot, a plot to make
most terrible things happen.

59
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:16,234
What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?

60
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,570
Can't say.

61
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:25,743
- Okay, I understand. You can't say.
- Don't make me talk. I--

62
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:30,456
- Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down.
- Bad Dobby.

63
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:34,669
So when they arrive at the ninth hole...

64
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:39,841
Give me the lamp.

65
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,970
Dobby, stop!

66
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:49,141
- Let me go.
- Get in there and keep quiet.

67
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:53,354
- What the devil are you doing up here?
- I was just--

68
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:56,274
You just ruined the punch line
of my Japanese golfer joke.

69
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:58,276
Sorry.

70
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,948
One more sound and you'll wish
you'd never been born, boy.

71
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:07,869
- And fix that door.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,789
See why I've got to go back?

73
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:15,710
I don't belong here.
I belong in your world, at Hogwarts.

74
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:20,506
- It's the only place I've got friends.
- Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?

75
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:23,634
Well, I expect they've been...

76
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:28,472
Hang on. How do you know
my friends haven't been writing to me?

77
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:31,976
Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby.

78
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:36,355
Dobby hoped if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him...

79
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:40,192
...Harry Potter might not want
to go back to school, sir.

80
00:06:41,027 --> 00:06:45,823
- Give me those. Now.
- No!

81
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:01,380
Dobby, get back here.

82
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,887
Dobby, please, no.

83
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:12,224
Harry Potter must say
he's not going back to school.

84
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:15,019
I can't. Hogwarts is my home.

85
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:21,275
Then Dobby must do it, sir,
for Harry Potter's own good.

86
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:26,447
It spread as far as the eye
could see, all over the floor.

87
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:28,574
One plumber said,
"Look at all that water."

88
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:31,744
The second plumber said,
"Yes, and that's just the top of it."

89
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,502
Mr. Mason...

90
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,549
Vernon tells me
that you're a wonderful golfer.

91
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:48,511
I play. Occasionally.

92
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,346
Hm.

93
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,807
Mrs. Mason...

94
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,559
...where do you get your
beautiful suits?

95
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:59,021
Oh, all of my suits are tailor-made.

96
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,442
Dudley...

97
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:07,238
...wasn't there something
you wanted to say?

98
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:12,993
- Pudding.
- Pudding?

99
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:14,662
What pudding?

100
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:24,880
I'm so sorry. It's my nephew.
He's very disturbed.

101
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:29,385
Meeting strangers upsets him.
That's why I kept him upstairs.

102
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:35,266
Well, we have ice cream.

103
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,778
You're never going back to that school.

104
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:52,992
You're never going to see those
freaky friends of yours again. Never!

105
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:40,289
Hiya, Harry.

106
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:45,836
Ron. Fred. George.
What are you all doing here?

107
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:49,882
Rescuing you, of course.
Now, come on, get your trunk.

108
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,307
You better stand back.

109
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,851
Let's go.

110
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:07,525
- What was that?
- What was it?

111
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:12,029
Potter!

112
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:13,864
Dad, what's going on?

113
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,160
Go. Go. Go.

114
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,370
Dad, hurry up.

115
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,415
- Come on.
- Come on, Harry, hurry up.

116
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:27,211
Petunia, he's escaping!

117
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:30,923
- I've got you, Harry.
- Come here!

118
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:33,217
- Let go of me!
- No, boy!

119
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:36,387
You and that bloody pigeon
aren't going anywhere.

120
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:38,180
- Get off!
- Drive!

121
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,224
- Right.
- Right!

122
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:42,059
No! No! No! No!

123
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,232
Dad!

124
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:58,868
Damn.

125
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:06,876
By the way, Harry, happy birthday.

126
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,987
Come on.

127
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,617
Okay, come on. Shh, shh.

128
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:42,661
Okay, come on.

129
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,922
Think it'd be all right
if we had some?

130
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,965
Yeah, Mum will never know.

131
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:14,860
It's not much, but it's home.

132
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,321
I think it's brilliant.

133
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:21,825
Where have you been?

134
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:25,287
Harry, how wonderful to see you, dear.

135
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:29,041
Beds empty. No note. Car gone.

136
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:32,211
You could have died.
You could have been seen.

137
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:35,464
Of course, I don't
blame you, Harry, dear.

138
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:38,634
They were starving him, Mum.
There were bars on his window.

139
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:43,555
Well, you best hope I don't put bars
on your window, Ronald Weasley.

140
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,849
Come on, Harry,
time for a spot of breakfast.

141
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,812
Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in.

142
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:53,524
That's it. There we go.

143
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:57,528
- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
- Yes, dear, it was on the cat.

144
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,822
Hello.

145
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,494
What did I do?

146
00:13:05,661 --> 00:13:10,249
Ginny. She's been talking about you
all summer. A bit annoying, really.

147
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,043
- Morning, Weasleys.
- Morning, Dad.

148
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:17,756
- What a night. Nine raids.
- Raids?

149
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:21,885
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic,
in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.

150
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:25,389
Dad loves Muggles,
thinks they're fascinating.

151
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:27,766
Well, now.

152
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:30,894
And who are you?

153
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:35,232
Oh, sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir.
Harry Potter.

154
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:38,527
Good Lord. Are you really?

155
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:43,407
Well, Ron has told us all about you,
of course. When did he get here?

156
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,075
This morning.

157
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:50,497
Your sons flew that enchanted car
of yours to Surrey and back last night.

158
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:54,084
Did you really? How did it go?

159
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:59,089
I mean-- That was very wrong
indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.

160
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:04,261
Now, Harry, you must know
all about Muggles.

161
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:08,557
Tell me, what exactly
is the function of a rubber duck?

162
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,060
Oh, um...

163
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,898
Well, that'll be Errol with the post.

164
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,448
Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?

165
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:28,035
- Errol.
- He's always doing that.

166
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:33,624
Oh, look, it's our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.

167
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,835
Dumbledore must know you're here.
Doesn't miss a trick, that man.

168
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,962
- Oh, no.
- This lot won't come cheap.

169
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:43,467
- The spell books alone are expensive.
- We'll manage.

170
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:48,472
There's only one place we're going to
get all of this. Diagon Alley.

171
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,100
Right.

172
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,352
Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.

173
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,480
But Harry's never traveled
by Floo powder before, Mum.

174
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:57,689
Floo powder?

175
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:02,152
You go first, Ron, so that Harry
can see how it's done. Yes.

176
00:15:02,778 --> 00:15:04,655
In you go.

177
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:06,698
That's it.

178
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:11,954
Diagon Alley.

179
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,463
You see? It's quite easy, dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.

180
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:24,466
Come on.

181
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:27,803
In you go. That's it. Mind your head.

182
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,390
That's right.
Now, take your Floo powder.

183
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:35,394
That's it, very good.

184
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:39,898
Now, don't forget to speak
very, very clearly.

185
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,153
Diagonally.

186
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,995
- What did he say, dear?
- Diagonally.

187
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:54,246
I thought he did.

188
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:15,035
Don't touch anything, Draco.

189
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,412
Yes, Father.

190
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:35,347
Master Malfoy,
what a pleasure to see you again.

191
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:38,892
And young Master Malfoy too.
Delighted.

192
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,104
I must show you, just in today
and very reasonably priced--

193
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:44,815
I'm not buying today, Borgin,
I'm selling.

194
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:47,401
- Selling?
- Draco.

195
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:53,240
You are aware, no doubt,
that the Ministry of Magic...

196
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,493
...is conducting more raids
on private houses.

197
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,663
There's even rumors of a new
Muggle Protection Act.

198
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:04,418
Pure wizard blood is counting for less
everywhere, I'm afraid.

199
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,420
Not with me.

200
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:09,631
Anyway, I brought a few items from home...

201
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:14,303
...that might prove, ahem, embarrassing
were the Ministry to call.

202
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:17,389
Just poisons and the like.

203
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,020
Look at that.

204
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:27,274
That particular item...

205
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:28,942
...is not for sale.

206
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,028
I understand.

207
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,196
It has unique qualities.

208
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:37,576
One wouldn't want to see it
falling into the wrong hands.

209
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,467
You can keep the box.

210
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,138
What did I say?

211
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,517
Touch nothing.

212
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:05,270
- Exactly.
- Sorry, Father.

213
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:09,900
Come on, we're going.

214
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:13,653
It's a pleasure to do business
with you, Mr. Malfoy.

215
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,031
Always a pleasure.

216
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,843
Looking for something?

217
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,762
No, I...

218
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:40,430
I'm just in the wrong place.

219
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,391
Sorry.

220
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,644
Thank you.

221
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:06,540
- Not lost, are you, my dear?
- I'm fine, thank you. I was just going...

222
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:11,211
Come with us. We'll help you
find your way back.

223
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,297
- No. Please-- Hagrid!
- Harry?

224
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,385
What do you think
you're doing down here? Come on.

225
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:29,479
You're a mess, Harry. Skulking
around Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.

226
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:33,650
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.

227
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:36,027
I was lost, I--

228
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:39,156
Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?

229
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:44,494
Me? I was... I was looking
for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.

230
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:47,539
They're ruining all the school cabbages.

231
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,172
Harry. Hagrid.

232
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:56,756
Hello, Hermione.

233
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:59,759
- It's so good to see you.
- It's great to see you too.

234
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:03,013
What did you do to your glasses?

235
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,057
<i>Oculus Reparo.</i>

236
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,272
I definitely need to remember that one.

237
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:16,193
You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Right. I'll leave you to it.

238
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,777
- Okay, bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

239
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:19,946
Come on, everyone's been so worried.

240
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:31,791
Oh, Harry.

241
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,212
Thank goodness. We'd hoped
you'd only gone one grate too far.

242
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:38,215
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.

243
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,675
Here he is.

244
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:46,264
Mum fancies him.

245
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:49,726
Make way there, please.
Let me by, madam. Thank you.

246
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:53,313
Excuse me, little girl.
This is for the <i>Daily Prophet.</i>

247
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:00,403
It can't be. Harry Potter?

248
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:03,782
Harry Potter!

249
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:05,200
Excuse me, madam.

250
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:10,997
Nice big smile, Harry.
Together, you and I rate the front page.

251
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:14,334
Ladies and gentlemen,
what an extraordinary moment this is.

252
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:17,921
When young Harry stepped
into Flourish and Blotts this morning...

253
00:22:18,088 --> 00:22:22,217
...to purchase my autobiography,
<i>Magical Me...</i>

254
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,598
...which, incidentally,
is currently celebrating...

255
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:33,603
...its 27th week atop
the <i>Daily Prophet</i> bestseller list...

256
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:38,275
...he had no idea that he would,
in fact, be leaving...

257
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:44,322
...with my entire collected works...

258
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:47,117
...free of charge.

259
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:51,538
Now, ladies?

260
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:54,874
Harry, now you give me those,
and I'll get them signed.

261
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,545
All of you wait outside.
That's it.

262
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:10,348
I'll bet you loved that,
didn't you, Potter?

263
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:15,020
Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a
bookshop without making the front page.

264
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,355
Leave him alone.

265
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:21,026
Look, Potter.
You've got yourself a girlfriend.

266
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:25,280
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.

267
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:26,865
Mr. Potter.

268
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:33,330
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.

269
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,665
Forgive me.

270
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:39,085
Your scar is legend.

271
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:41,880
As, of course, is the wizard
who gave it to you.

272
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:44,382
Voldemort killed my parents.

273
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:49,929
He was nothing more than a murderer.

274
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:53,892
You must be very brave
to mention his name.

275
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,894
Or very foolish.

276
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:59,856
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.

277
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:04,736
And you must be Miss Granger.

278
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:11,868
Yes, Draco has told me
all about you. And your parents.

279
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:19,959
Muggles, aren't they?

280
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:28,051
Let me see.
Red hair, vacant expressions...

281
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:32,764
...tatty, secondhand book.

282
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:36,351
You must be the Weasleys.

283
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:38,770
It's mad in here.
Let's go outside.

284
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:42,649
- Well, Weasley senior.
- Lucius.

285
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:47,570
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur,
all those extra raids?

286
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:50,073
I do hope they're paying you overtime...

287
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,410
...but judging by the state of this,
I'd say not.

288
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:58,915
What's the use in being a disgrace
to the name of wizard...

289
00:24:59,082 --> 00:25:01,167
...if they don't even pay you well for it?

290
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:06,464
We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

291
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:08,508
Clearly.

292
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:14,305
Associating with Muggles.

293
00:25:18,518 --> 00:25:23,106
And I thought your family
could sink no lower.

294
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:29,195
I'll see you at work.

295
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:35,702
See you at school.

296
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:44,794
10:58, come on.

297
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,212
The train will leave soon.

298
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:49,674
Fred, George, Percy, you first.

299
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:56,931
Okay.

300
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:04,689
After you, dear.

301
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:10,069
Come on, Ginny,
we'll get you a seat. Hurry.

302
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,573
Let's go.

303
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:30,632
- What do you two think you're doing?
- Sorry.

304
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:34,093
Lost control of the trolley.

305
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,764
- Why can't we get through?
- I don't know.

306
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:41,267
The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.

307
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:46,606
The train leaves at exactly 11:00.
We've missed it.

308
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:50,109
Harry, if we can't get through...

309
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:53,112
...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.

310
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:57,492
Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.

311
00:26:58,576 --> 00:26:59,869
The car.

312
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:09,128
There we go.

313
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,840
Now, all we need to do is find
the Hogwarts Express.

314
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:15,593
Ron, are you sure you know
how to fly this?

315
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,679
No problem.

316
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:25,645
Look out!

317
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:27,730
Aah!

318
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,027
Ron, I should tell you...

319
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:36,990
...most Muggles aren't accustomed
to seeing a flying car.

320
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,283
Right.

321
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:39,617
Okay.

322
00:27:56,884 --> 00:28:00,179
Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster
must be faulty.

323
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:03,808
Come on, then. Let's go lower.
We need to find the train.

324
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:05,226
Okay.

325
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:18,197
All we need to do
is catch up with the train.

326
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,033
We can't be far behind.

327
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:24,746
- Do you hear that?
- We must be getting close.

328
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:27,332
Hold on.

329
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,777
Harry!

330
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,239
Hold on!

331
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:06,079
Take my hand!

332
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,584
Hold on!

333
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:15,380
I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.

334
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:31,229
- I think we found the train.
- Yeah.

335
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:49,205
Welcome home.

336
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,514
Up! Up!

337
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,642
It's not working!

338
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:16,149
Up! Ron, mind that tree!

339
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:21,529
Stop! Stop! Stop!

340
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:49,307
- My wand. Look at my wand.
- Be thankful it's not your neck.

341
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:53,895
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

342
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:31,516
Come on, go! Fast!

343
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:08,636
Scabbers, you're okay.

344
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:12,223
The car!

345
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:29,490
Dad's gonna kill me.

346
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:40,418
See you, Hedwig.

347
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:44,088
So a house-elf shows up
in my bedroom...

348
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:47,174
...we can't get through the barrier
to platform 9 3/4...

349
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:50,595
...we almost get killed by a tree...

350
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:54,307
Clearly someone doesn't want me
here this year.

351
00:32:57,935 --> 00:33:00,855
Well, take a good look, lads.

352
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:04,942
This night might well be
the last you spend in this castle.

353
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:11,282
Oh, dear, we are in trouble.

354
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:17,705
You were seen by no less
than seven Muggles.

355
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:20,958
Do you have any idea how serious this is?

356
00:33:21,626 --> 00:33:25,463
You have risked the exposure of our world.

357
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,050
Not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a Whomping Willow...

358
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:32,428
...that's been on these grounds
since before you were born.

359
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:36,432
Honestly, Professor Snape,
I think it did more damage to us.

360
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,725
Silence.

361
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:46,150
I assure you that were you in Slytherin,
and your fate rested with me...

362
00:33:46,317 --> 00:33:50,071
...the both of you would be
on the train home tonight.

363
00:33:51,238 --> 00:33:53,491
- As it is--
- They are not.

364
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:59,747
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.

365
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:01,666
Headmaster...

366
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:06,587
...these boys have flouted the Decree
for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.

367
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:10,675
- As such--
- I am well aware of our bylaws...

368
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:13,719
...having written
quite a few of them myself.

369
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:17,348
However, as head of Gryffindor house...

370
00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:22,520
...it is for Professor McGonagall
to determine the appropriate action.

371
00:34:22,979 --> 00:34:25,106
We'll go and get our stuff, then.

372
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:27,733
What are you
talking about, Mr. Weasley?

373
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,111
You're going to expel us, aren't you?

374
00:34:31,696 --> 00:34:34,782
Not today, Mr. Weasley...

375
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:39,996
...but I must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done.

376
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:45,126
I will be writing to your families tonight,
and you will both receive detention.

377
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:50,589
And now I suggest
that we all return to the feast.

378
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:55,428
There is a delicious-looking custard tart
that I am most anxious to sample.

379
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,446
Mr. Filch, you dropped this.

380
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:47,271
Morning, everyone.

381
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:50,483
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning, Professor Sprout.

382
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:54,904
Welcome to Greenhouse Three,
second years. Gather around, everyone.

383
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,907
Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.

384
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:00,910
Who here can tell me
the properties of the Mandrake root?

385
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:03,996
Yes, Miss Granger?

386
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:06,499
Mandrake, or Mandragora...

387
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:11,670
...is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state.

388
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:16,842
It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

389
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:19,845
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.

390
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:22,723
As our Mandrakes
are still only seedlings...

391
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,767
...their cries won't kill you yet.

392
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:28,771
But they could knock you out for hours,
which is why I have given you earmuffs...

393
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:30,439
...for auditory protection.

394
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:35,027
So could you please put them on,
right away? Quickly.

395
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:37,988
Flaps tight down,
and watch me closely.

396
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:41,158
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.

397
00:36:41,325 --> 00:36:44,328
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.

398
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,501
Got it? And...

399
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:52,837
...now you dunk it down
into the other pot...

400
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:57,758
...and pour a little sprinkling of soil
to keep him warm.

401
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:04,557
Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs.

402
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:09,019
- No, ma'am, he's just fainted.
- Yes, well, just leave him there.

403
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:12,982
Right, on we go.
Plenty of pots to go around.

404
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:16,694
Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.

405
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:35,421
- There's Nearly Headless Nick.
- Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.

406
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:38,173
Hello, Sir Nicholas.

407
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:52,897
Say it. I'm doomed.

408
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:55,691
- You're doomed.
- Hi, Harry.

409
00:37:57,902 --> 00:38:00,613
I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.

410
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:02,406
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.

411
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:06,076
Say, do you think your friend here
could take a photo of me and you...

412
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,787
...standing together?
To prove I've met you.

413
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,123
It's for my dad.
He's a milkman, you know.

414
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,584
A Muggle, like all our
family's been until me.

415
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:17,546
No one knew the stuff I could do was
magic till we got letters from Hogwarts.

416
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:20,883
- Everyone just thought I was mental.
- Imagine that.

417
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:24,386
Ron, is that your owl?

418
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:41,779
Bloody bird's a menace.

419
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,451
Oh, no.

420
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:51,121
Look, everyone.
Weasley's got himself a Howler.

421
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:57,795
Go on, Ron. I ignored one
from my gran once. It was horrible.

422
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:06,845
<i>Ronald Weasley!</i>

423
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:15,562
<i>How dare you steal that car!
I am absolutely disgusted!</i>

424
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,482
<i>Your father's now facing
an inquiry at work...</i>

425
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:20,985
<i>...and it's entirely your fault!</i>

426
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:25,322
<i>If you put another toe out of line...</i>

427
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:28,742
<i>...we'll bring you straight home!</i>

428
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:33,038
<i>And, Ginny, dear, congratulations
on making Gryffindor.</i>

429
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:36,959
<i>Your father and I are so proud.</i>

430
00:39:55,185 --> 00:40:01,608
Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

431
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,360
Me.

432
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:06,030
Gilderoy Lockhart...

433
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:09,533
...Order of Merlin, Third Class...

434
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,037
...honorary member
of the Dark Force Defense League...

435
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:16,081
...and five times winner...

436
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:22,296
...of <i>Witch Weekly's</i>
Most-Charming-Smile Award.

437
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:24,214
But I don't talk about that.

438
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:28,886
I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee
by smiling at him.

439
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:36,143
I see you've bought a complete set
of my books. Well done.

440
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:40,439
Now, I thought we'd start today
with a little quiz.

441
00:40:43,817 --> 00:40:45,652
Nothing to worry about.

442
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:49,448
Just to check how well you've read them.

443
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:51,200
Thank you.

444
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:55,704
How much you've taken in.

445
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:04,213
Look at these questions.
They're all about him.

446
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,549
"What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
favorite color?"

447
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:12,721
"What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
greatest achievement to date?"

448
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,477
You have 30 minutes. Start...

449
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:23,482
...now!

450
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,490
Tut-tut.

451
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:35,786
Hardly any of you remembered
that my favorite color is lilac.

452
00:41:36,078 --> 00:41:37,996
But Miss Hermione Granger...

453
00:41:38,539 --> 00:41:42,918
...knew that my secret ambition
is to rid the world of evil...

454
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:46,672
...and market my own range
of hair-care potions. Good girl.

455
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:51,009
Now, be warned.

456
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,303
It is my job to arm you...

457
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:58,809
...against the foulest creatures
known to wizardkind.

458
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:03,230
You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.

459
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:07,442
Know only that no harm
can befall you whilst I am here.

460
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:10,571
I must ask you not to scream.

461
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:13,282
It might provoke them.

462
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:18,287
Cornish pixies?

463
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:21,540
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

464
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:24,418
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...

465
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:28,755
...but pixies can be
devilishly tricky little blighters.

466
00:42:28,922 --> 00:42:31,842
Let's see what you make of them.

467
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,433
Come on now, round them up.
They're only pixies.

468
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:59,328
- You just stay there!
- Please, get me down!

469
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:04,124
- Get off me!
- Stop. Hold still!

470
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:08,962
<i>Peskipiksi Pesternomi!</i>

471
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:33,236
I'll ask you three to just nip
the rest of them back into their cage.

472
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:37,157
What do we do now?

473
00:43:38,659 --> 00:43:40,160
<i>Immobulus!</i>

474
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:51,880
Why is it always me?

475
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:00,973
I spent the summer devising
a whole new Quidditch program.

476
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:04,810
We're gonna train earlier,
harder and longer.

477
00:44:04,977 --> 00:44:08,271
What--? I don't believe it.

478
00:44:11,066 --> 00:44:13,777
- Where you think you're going, Flint?
- Quidditch practice.

479
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:18,323
- I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
- Easy, Wood. I've got a note.

480
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:21,952
Uh-oh. I smell trouble.

481
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:26,081
"I, Professor Severus Snape,
do hereby give the Slytherin team...

482
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:29,751
...permission to practice today, owing
to the need to train their new Seeker."

483
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:32,587
You've got a new Seeker. Who?

484
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,177
- Malfoy?
- That's right.

485
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:42,139
And that's not all that's new this year.

486
00:44:42,973 --> 00:44:46,435
Those are Nimbus 2001s.
How did you get those?

487
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,645
A gift from Draco's father.

488
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:52,607
You see, Weasley, unlike some,
my father can afford the best.

489
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:55,777
At least no one on the Gryffindor team
had to buy their way in.

490
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:58,822
They got in on pure talent.

491
00:45:02,034 --> 00:45:05,954
No one asked your opinion,
you filthy little Mudblood.

492
00:45:08,457 --> 00:45:11,877
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat slugs!

493
00:45:19,468 --> 00:45:21,303
You okay, Ron?

494
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:26,141
Say something.

495
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:36,860
- Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
- No, Colin, get out of the way.

496
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,821
Let's take him to Hagrid's.

497
00:45:39,988 --> 00:45:42,157
He'll know what to do.

498
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:54,377
This calls for
a specialist's equipment.

499
00:45:58,173 --> 00:46:01,718
Nothing to do but wait till it stops,
I'm afraid.

500
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:05,555
- Okay.
- Better out than in.

501
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:11,520
- Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
- Malfoy. He called Hermione...

502
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:16,108
Well, I don't know exactly what it means.

503
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:22,280
He called me a Mudblood.

504
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:25,117
- He did not.
- What's a Mudblood?

505
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:30,038
It means "dirty blood." Mudblood's a foul
name for someone who's Muggle-born.

506
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:34,459
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.

507
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,089
It's not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation.

508
00:46:40,257 --> 00:46:45,053
See, the thing is, Harry, there are
some wizards, like the Malfoy family...

509
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:49,891
...who think they're better than everyone
else because they're pure-blood.

510
00:46:50,058 --> 00:46:51,726
That's horrible.

511
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:56,064
It's disgusting.

512
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:59,734
And it's codswallop to boot.
Dirty blood.

513
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:03,238
Why, there isn't a wizard alive today
that's not half-blood or less.

514
00:47:03,405 --> 00:47:07,951
More to the point, they've yet to think
of a spell that our Hermione can't do.

515
00:47:08,118 --> 00:47:10,370
Come here.

516
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:17,919
Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.

517
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:19,796
Aye?

518
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:28,763
Harry, Harry, Harry.

519
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,141
Can you possibly imagine...

520
00:47:31,308 --> 00:47:34,519
...a better way to serve detention...

521
00:47:35,145 --> 00:47:37,856
...than by helping me
to answer my fan mail?

522
00:47:38,023 --> 00:47:39,441
Not really.

523
00:47:39,608 --> 00:47:45,989
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.

524
00:47:46,156 --> 00:47:48,116
Remember that.

525
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:53,997
<i>Come.</i>

526
00:47:54,164 --> 00:47:56,291
<i>Come...</i>

527
00:47:57,542 --> 00:48:00,462
<i>...to me.</i>

528
00:48:03,715 --> 00:48:06,301
- What?
- Sorry?

529
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,472
That voice.

530
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:12,182
Voice?

531
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:20,357
- Didn't you hear it?
- What are you talking about, Harry?

532
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:24,569
I think you're getting a bit drowsy.

533
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:28,823
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.

534
00:48:29,157 --> 00:48:32,494
Spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun.

535
00:48:37,499 --> 00:48:40,001
Spooky.

536
00:48:43,046 --> 00:48:45,173
<i>Blood.</i>

537
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,885
<i>I smell blood.</i>

538
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:52,180
<i>Let me rip you.</i>

539
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:55,892
<i>Let me kill you.</i>

540
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:59,187
<i>Kill!</i>

541
00:49:00,105 --> 00:49:01,481
<i>Kill!</i>

542
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:04,067
<i>- Kill!</i>
- Harry!

543
00:49:04,234 --> 00:49:06,736
- Did you hear it?
- Hear what?

544
00:49:06,903 --> 00:49:10,365
- That voice.
- Voice? What voice?

545
00:49:10,532 --> 00:49:14,494
I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
And then again just--

546
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:16,871
<i>It's time.</i>

547
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:20,208
It's moving.
I think it's going to kill.

548
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:25,130
- Kill?
- Harry, wait! Not so fast!

549
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:52,782
Strange.

550
00:49:53,283 --> 00:49:57,787
- I've never seen spiders act like that.
- I don't like spiders.

551
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:03,960
What's that?

552
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:09,924
"The Chamber
of Secrets has been opened.

553
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:11,968
Enemies of the Heir, beware."

554
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:14,429
It's written in blood.

555
00:50:17,307 --> 00:50:19,476
Oh, no.

556
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:26,483
It's Filch's cat.

557
00:50:26,983 --> 00:50:29,277
It's Mrs. Norris.

558
00:50:45,335 --> 00:50:48,088
"Enemies of the Heir, beware."

559
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:51,966
You'll be next, Mudbloods.

560
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:57,305
What's going on here?
Go on. Make way, make way.

561
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:00,558
Potter?

562
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:02,852
What are you...?

563
00:51:06,189 --> 00:51:08,483
Mrs. Norris?

564
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:14,155
- You've murdered my cat.
- No. No.

565
00:51:14,531 --> 00:51:15,824
I'll kill you.

566
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:20,995
- I'll kill you!
- Argus!

567
00:51:22,372 --> 00:51:24,541
Argus, I...

568
00:51:26,543 --> 00:51:31,172
Everyone will proceed
to their dormitories immediately.

569
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:33,883
Everyone except...

570
00:51:34,676 --> 00:51:36,886
...you three.

571
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:41,766
Ravenclaws, follow me.

572
00:51:43,685 --> 00:51:47,522
She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.

573
00:51:47,689 --> 00:51:50,525
Ah. Thought so.
So unlucky I wasn't there.

574
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:53,903
I know exactly the countercurse
that could've spared her.

575
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:58,867
But how she has been Petrified,
I cannot say.

576
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:01,870
Ask him.
It's him that's done it.

577
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:04,706
You saw what he wrote on the wall.

578
00:52:04,873 --> 00:52:08,960
It's not true, sir. I swear.
I never touched Mrs. Norris.

579
00:52:09,169 --> 00:52:13,590
- Rubbish.
- If I might, headmaster?

580
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:18,887
Perhaps Potter and his friends were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

581
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:21,264
However...

582
00:52:21,598 --> 00:52:24,559
...the circumstances are suspicious.

583
00:52:24,726 --> 00:52:29,397
I, for one, don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.

584
00:52:29,564 --> 00:52:31,774
I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.

585
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:35,403
You see, Harry was helping me
answer my fan mail.

586
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,823
That's why Ron and I
went looking for him, professor.

587
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:41,743
We'd just found him when he said...

588
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:47,832
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- When I said I wasn't hungry.

589
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:53,254
We were heading back to the common
room when we found Mrs. Norris.

590
00:52:55,590 --> 00:53:01,095
- Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
- My cat has been Petrified.

591
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:07,769
- I want to see some punishment!
- We will be able to cure her, Argus.

592
00:53:08,728 --> 00:53:13,483
As I understand it, Madam Sprout
has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.

593
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:18,112
When matured, a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris.

594
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:20,114
And in the meantime...

595
00:53:20,657 --> 00:53:24,661
...I strongly recommend caution...

596
00:53:25,328 --> 00:53:27,330
...to all.

597
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:41,803
- It's a bit strange, isn't it?
- Strange?

598
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:44,722
You hear this voice,
a voice only you can hear...

599
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:49,644
...and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. It's just strange.

600
00:53:49,811 --> 00:53:53,022
Do you think I should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, I mean?

601
00:53:53,189 --> 00:53:54,649
Are you mad?

602
00:53:54,816 --> 00:54:00,321
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,
hearing voices isn't a good sign.

603
00:54:02,407 --> 00:54:04,826
She's right, you know.

604
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:11,499
Could I have
your attention, please?

605
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,505
Right. Now, today,
we will be transforming animals...

606
00:54:17,672 --> 00:54:20,049
...into water goblets.

607
00:54:21,009 --> 00:54:22,677
Like so.

608
00:54:22,844 --> 00:54:27,724
One, two, three.
<i>Vera Verto.</i>

609
00:54:31,311 --> 00:54:35,189
Now it's your turn.
Who would like to go first?

610
00:54:35,815 --> 00:54:40,737
Mr. Weasley.
"One, two, three. <i>Vera Verto."</i>

611
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:46,409
<i>Vera Verto!</i>

612
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,209
That wand needs
replacing, Mr. Weasley.

613
00:54:56,544 --> 00:54:58,713
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- Professor...

614
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,092
...I was wondering if you could tell us
about the Chamber of Secrets.

615
00:55:09,265 --> 00:55:10,558
Very well.

616
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,062
You all know, of course...

617
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:18,066
...that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago...

618
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:22,654
...by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age:

619
00:55:22,862 --> 00:55:26,574
Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff...

620
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:32,413
...Rowena Ravenclaw
and Salazar Slytherin.

621
00:55:33,081 --> 00:55:39,087
Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.

622
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:42,256
- One did not.
- Three guesses who.

623
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:45,426
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective...

624
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:48,763
...about the students admitted
to Hogwarts.

625
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:53,518
He believed magical learning should
be kept within all-magic families.

626
00:55:53,685 --> 00:55:55,812
In other words, pure-bloods.

627
00:55:56,187 --> 00:56:01,526
Unable to sway the others,
he decided to leave the school.

628
00:56:02,402 --> 00:56:04,612
Now, according to legend...

629
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:08,491
...Slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this castle...

630
00:56:08,658 --> 00:56:12,328
...known as the Chamber of Secrets.

631
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:16,958
Though, shortly before departing,
he sealed it...

632
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:21,212
...until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.

633
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:23,798
The Heir alone...

634
00:56:23,965 --> 00:56:26,634
...would be able to open the Chamber...

635
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:31,514
...and unleash the horror within,
and by so doing...

636
00:56:31,681 --> 00:56:35,059
...purge the school
of all those who...

637
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:40,231
...in Slytherin's view,
were unworthy to study magic.

638
00:56:40,857 --> 00:56:42,984
Muggle-borns.

639
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:47,655
Naturally, the school
has been searched many times.

640
00:56:47,822 --> 00:56:51,325
No such chamber has been found.

641
00:56:51,868 --> 00:56:56,539
Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?

642
00:56:57,373 --> 00:57:00,001
The Chamber is said to be home
to something...

643
00:57:00,168 --> 00:57:03,713
...that only the Heir of Slytherin
can control.

644
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:08,009
It is said to be the home...

645
00:57:08,176 --> 00:57:09,761
...of a monster.

646
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:19,187
Do you think it's true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

647
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:23,566
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All the teachers are.

648
00:57:23,733 --> 00:57:27,570
If there really is a Chamber of Secrets,
and it has been opened, that means--

649
00:57:27,737 --> 00:57:31,699
The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

650
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:36,245
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?

651
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:39,081
- If you're talking about Malfoy--
- Of course. You heard him.

652
00:57:39,248 --> 00:57:40,958
"You'll be next, Mudbloods."

653
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:43,753
I heard him.
But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?

654
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,089
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
I mean, look at his family.

655
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:50,051
The whole lot of them have been
in Slytherin for centuries.

656
00:57:50,218 --> 00:57:53,638
Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.

657
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:58,267
Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.

658
00:57:58,434 --> 00:58:00,269
Mind you, it would be difficult.

659
00:58:00,436 --> 00:58:03,481
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about 50 school rules...

660
00:58:03,648 --> 00:58:08,110
...and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.

661
00:58:14,951 --> 00:58:17,411
Here it is. The Polyjuice Potion.

662
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:20,289
"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion
allows the drinker...

663
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:24,752
...to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another."

664
00:58:24,919 --> 00:58:28,673
You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff,
we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

665
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:32,260
- Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
- Exactly.

666
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:36,264
But it's tricky. I've never seen
a more complicated potion.

667
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:39,559
- How long will it take to make?
- A month.

668
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:41,352
A month?

669
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:45,356
But, Hermione,
if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...

670
00:58:45,565 --> 00:58:48,776
...he could attack half
the Muggle-borns in the school by then.

671
00:58:48,943 --> 00:58:50,820
I know.

672
00:58:50,987 --> 00:58:53,823
But it's the only plan we've got.

673
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:46,208
Another goal for Slytherin!

674
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:50,922
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.

675
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:53,674
Yeah!

676
00:59:53,925 --> 00:59:55,718
Yeah!

677
01:00:19,951 --> 01:00:22,286
All right there, Scarhead?

678
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,920
Watch yourself, Harry!

679
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:33,089
Wood, look out!

680
01:01:06,247 --> 01:01:09,083
Blimey! Harry's got himself
a rogue Bludger.

681
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:11,043
That's been tampered with, that has.

682
01:01:12,044 --> 01:01:13,087
I'll stop it.

683
01:01:13,254 --> 01:01:17,883
No! Even with a proper wand,
it's too risky. You could hit Harry.

684
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:45,494
Training for the ballet, Potter?

685
01:02:16,484 --> 01:02:18,736
You'll never catch me, Potter.

686
01:03:49,535 --> 01:03:50,578
Let's go.

687
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:55,958
<i>Harry Potter has caught
the Snitch. Gryffindor wins!</i>

688
01:04:02,256 --> 01:04:04,341
<i>Finite Incantatem!</i>

689
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:12,725
- Thank you.
- Are you okay?

690
01:04:12,892 --> 01:04:14,977
No. I think my arm is broken.

691
01:04:15,144 --> 01:04:17,646
Not to worry. I will fix
that arm of yours straightaway.

692
01:04:17,855 --> 01:04:22,067
- No. Not you.
- Boy doesn't know what he's saying.

693
01:04:22,234 --> 01:04:25,779
This won't hurt a bit.

694
01:04:31,911 --> 01:04:34,914
<i>Brackium Emendo!</i>

695
01:04:42,922 --> 01:04:46,008
Yes, well,
that can sometimes happen...

696
01:04:46,175 --> 01:04:48,427
...but the point is...

697
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:53,933
...you can no longer feel any pain, and,
very clearly, the bones are not broken.

698
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:56,769
Broken? There's no bones left.

699
01:04:58,479 --> 01:05:00,439
Much more flexible, though.

700
01:05:02,942 --> 01:05:06,820
Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.
You can go. Out of my way.

701
01:05:06,987 --> 01:05:08,948
Should have been brought straight to me.

702
01:05:09,114 --> 01:05:11,659
I can mend bones in a heartbeat,
but growing them back...

703
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:13,327
You will be able to, won't you?

704
01:05:13,494 --> 01:05:16,622
I'll be able to, certainly.
But it'll be painful.

705
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:21,961
You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Regrowing bones is a nasty business.

706
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:27,841
What do you expect?
Pumpkin juice?

707
01:05:34,473 --> 01:05:36,225
<i>Kill.</i>

708
01:05:37,059 --> 01:05:38,644
<i>Kill.</i>

709
01:05:43,983 --> 01:05:47,194
<i>Time to kill.</i>

710
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:54,368
Hello.

711
01:05:56,161 --> 01:05:57,204
Dobby?

712
01:05:57,371 --> 01:05:59,707
Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby.

713
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:03,877
Harry Potter should have gone back home
when he missed the train.

714
01:06:04,044 --> 01:06:08,674
It was you. You stopped the barrier
from letting Ron and me through.

715
01:06:09,008 --> 01:06:11,969
Indeed. Yes, sir.

716
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:18,017
- You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
- At least you would be away from here.

717
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:20,853
Harry Potter must go home.

718
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:24,565
Dobby thought his Bludger would be
enough to make Harry Potter see--

719
01:06:24,732 --> 01:06:28,110
Your Bludger? You made
that Bludger chase after me?

720
01:06:28,277 --> 01:06:31,864
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.

721
01:06:32,031 --> 01:06:35,701
Dobby had to iron his hands.

722
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:42,499
You better clear off before my bones
come back, or I might strangle you.

723
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:47,087
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.

724
01:06:47,254 --> 01:06:50,299
Dobby gets them five times a day at home.

725
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:53,260
I don't suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?

726
01:06:53,552 --> 01:06:57,431
Not kill you, sir.
Never kill you.

727
01:06:57,598 --> 01:07:00,934
Dobby remembers how it was
before Harry Potter triumphed...

728
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:04,229
...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

729
01:07:04,396 --> 01:07:08,108
We house-elves were
treated like vermin, sir.

730
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:13,739
Of course, Dobby is still
treated like vermin.

731
01:07:23,082 --> 01:07:25,667
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

732
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:30,964
This, sir? It is a mark
of the house-elf's enslavement.

733
01:07:31,131 --> 01:07:35,594
Dobby can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes.

734
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:39,765
Listen.

735
01:07:39,932 --> 01:07:41,475
Listen!

736
01:07:41,642 --> 01:07:45,354
Terrible things are
about to happen at Hogwarts.

737
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:48,440
Harry Potter must not stay here...

738
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:53,153
...now that history
is to repeat itself.

739
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,782
Repeat itself? You mean
this has happened before?

740
01:07:56,949 --> 01:07:58,951
I shouldn't have said that.

741
01:08:02,663 --> 01:08:05,833
- Bad Dobby! Bad!
- Stop it!

742
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:07,668
Stop it, Dobby!

743
01:08:09,336 --> 01:08:13,173
Tell me. When did this happen before?
Who's doing it now?

744
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:18,554
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby
only wants Harry Potter to be safe.

745
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,014
No, Dobby. Tell me.
Who is it?

746
01:08:33,485 --> 01:08:34,611
Put him here.

747
01:08:39,158 --> 01:08:40,200
What happened?

748
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:42,161
There's been another attack.

749
01:08:42,327 --> 01:08:48,041
I think he's been Petrified,
Madam Pomfrey.

750
01:08:48,834 --> 01:08:53,547
Look. Perhaps he managed
to take a picture of his attacker.

751
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,391
What can this mean, Albus?

752
01:09:04,558 --> 01:09:06,518
It means...

753
01:09:06,894 --> 01:09:09,688
...that our students
are in great danger.

754
01:09:09,855 --> 01:09:13,233
- What should I tell the staff?
- The truth.

755
01:09:13,525 --> 01:09:17,279
Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe.

756
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:20,574
It is as we feared, Minerva.

757
01:09:20,866 --> 01:09:25,370
The Chamber of Secrets
has indeed been opened again.

758
01:09:28,207 --> 01:09:32,377
You mean the Chamber
of Secrets has been opened before?

759
01:09:32,544 --> 01:09:35,255
Of course.
Don't you see?

760
01:09:35,422 --> 01:09:38,425
Lucius Malfoy must have opened it
when he was at school here.

761
01:09:39,051 --> 01:09:41,637
- Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
- Maybe.

762
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:44,973
We'll have to wait for
the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.

763
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:49,102
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing
this potion in broad daylight...

764
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:53,232
...in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Don't you think we'll get caught?

765
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:56,777
No. No one ever comes in here.

766
01:09:57,611 --> 01:10:00,197
- Why?
- Moaning Myrtle.

767
01:10:00,364 --> 01:10:01,865
Who?

768
01:10:02,741 --> 01:10:04,451
Moaning Myrtle.

769
01:10:04,743 --> 01:10:08,080
- Who's Moaning Myrtle?
- I'm Moaning Myrtle.

770
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:16,421
I wouldn't expect you to know me.

771
01:10:16,588 --> 01:10:19,591
Who would ever talk
about ugly, miserable...

772
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:23,136
...moping Moaning Myrtle?

773
01:10:30,352 --> 01:10:32,479
She's a little sensitive.

774
01:10:36,984 --> 01:10:38,944
Gather round!

775
01:10:39,278 --> 01:10:44,283
Gather round.
Can everybody see me?

776
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:47,619
Can you all hear me?

777
01:10:48,287 --> 01:10:49,621
Excellent.

778
01:10:50,122 --> 01:10:53,792
In light of the dark events
of recent weeks...

779
01:10:53,959 --> 01:10:58,630
...Professor Dumbledore has granted me
permission to start this Dueling Club...

780
01:10:58,797 --> 01:11:03,468
...to train you all up in case
you ever need to defend yourselves...

781
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,305
...as I myself have done
on countless occasions.

782
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:10,142
For full details,
see my published works.

783
01:11:15,022 --> 01:11:18,483
That Lockhart's something, isn't he?
Awfully brave chap.

784
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:19,943
Justin Finch-Fletchley.

785
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:21,862
- Hufflepuff.
- Nice to meet you. I'm--

786
01:11:22,029 --> 01:11:25,282
I know who you are.
We all do, even us Muggle-borns.

787
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:28,577
Let me introduce my assistant...

788
01:11:28,744 --> 01:11:31,413
...Professor Snape.

789
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:37,502
He has sportingly agreed to help
with a short demonstration.

790
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:39,755
I don't want any of you
youngsters to worry.

791
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:44,801
You'll still have your Potions master
when I'm through with him. Never fear.

792
01:12:00,442 --> 01:12:02,069
One.

793
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:03,278
Two.

794
01:12:04,112 --> 01:12:07,115
- Three!
<i>- Expelliarmus!</i>

795
01:12:15,707 --> 01:12:18,377
- Do you think he's all right?
- Who cares?

796
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:21,505
An excellent idea to show them that,
Professor Snape...

797
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:26,218
...but if you don't mind me saying, it was
obvious what you were about to do.

798
01:12:26,426 --> 01:12:29,638
If I had wanted to stop you,
it would have been only too easy.

799
01:12:29,805 --> 01:12:33,308
Perhaps it would be prudent
to first teach the students...

800
01:12:33,475 --> 01:12:37,979
...to block unfriendly spells,
professor.

801
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:42,150
An excellent suggestion,
Professor Snape.

802
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:47,656
Let's have a volunteer pair.
Potter, Weasley, how about you?

803
01:12:47,823 --> 01:12:51,326
Weasley's wand causes
devastation with the simplest spells.

804
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:55,414
We'll be sending Potter
to the hospital wing in a matchbox.

805
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:59,668
Might I suggest someone from my own house?

806
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:03,463
Malfoy, perhaps?

807
01:13:10,971 --> 01:13:13,473
- Good luck, Potter.
- Thank you, sir.

808
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:23,400
Wands at the ready.

809
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:27,028
- Scared, Potter?
- You wish.

810
01:13:37,414 --> 01:13:39,124
On the count of three...

811
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:43,628
...cast your charms to disarm
your opponent. Only to disarm.

812
01:13:43,795 --> 01:13:47,382
We don't want any accidents here.
One.

813
01:13:49,134 --> 01:13:51,720
- Two.
<i>- Everte Statum!</i>

814
01:14:03,315 --> 01:14:05,567
<i>Rictusempra!</i>

815
01:14:16,578 --> 01:14:18,330
I said disarm only.

816
01:14:18,538 --> 01:14:20,540
<i>Serpensortia!</i>

817
01:14:29,174 --> 01:14:31,968
Don't move, Potter.
I'll get rid of it for you.

818
01:14:32,135 --> 01:14:37,599
Allow me, Professor Snape.
<i>Alarte Ascendare!</i>

819
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:22,811
<i>Vipera Evanesca.</i>

820
01:15:29,484 --> 01:15:31,861
What are you playing at?

821
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:47,335
You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?

822
01:15:47,502 --> 01:15:49,754
- I'm a what?
- You can talk to snakes.

823
01:15:49,921 --> 01:15:55,260
I know. I accidentally set a python
on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.

824
01:15:55,427 --> 01:15:59,389
Once. But so what?
I bet loads of people here can do it.

825
01:15:59,556 --> 01:16:03,351
No, they can't.
It's not a very common gift, Harry.

826
01:16:03,852 --> 01:16:05,520
This is bad.

827
01:16:05,687 --> 01:16:09,441
What's bad? If I hadn't told
that snake not to attack Justin--

828
01:16:09,649 --> 01:16:13,069
- That's what you said to it.
- You were there. You heard me.

829
01:16:13,236 --> 01:16:17,115
I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language.

830
01:16:17,282 --> 01:16:20,201
I spoke a different language?

831
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:23,622
But I didn't realize--

832
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:26,583
How can I speak a language
without knowing I can?

833
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:30,754
I don't know, but it sounded like you
were egging the snake on or something.

834
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,672
Harry, listen to me.

835
01:16:33,048 --> 01:16:35,925
There's a reason the symbol
of Slytherin house is a serpent.

836
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:40,597
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
He could talk to snakes too.

837
01:16:40,847 --> 01:16:41,890
Exactly.

838
01:16:42,057 --> 01:16:45,435
Now the whole school's gonna think
you're his great-great-great grandson.

839
01:16:45,602 --> 01:16:47,604
But I'm not.

840
01:16:50,315 --> 01:16:52,275
I can't be.

841
01:16:53,401 --> 01:16:55,445
He lived a thousand years ago.

842
01:16:55,612 --> 01:16:58,823
For all we know, you could be.

843
01:17:13,505 --> 01:17:15,674
Who am I, Hedwig?

844
01:17:16,549 --> 01:17:18,385
What am I?

845
01:17:54,129 --> 01:17:56,506
I'll see you back in the common room.

846
01:18:10,061 --> 01:18:14,357
So anyway, I told Justin
to hide up in our dormitory.

847
01:18:14,524 --> 01:18:18,903
I mean to say, if Potter has
marked him down as his next victim...

848
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:21,656
...it's best he keeps a low profile
for a while.

849
01:18:21,823 --> 01:18:24,576
But why would he want to attack Justin?

850
01:18:24,743 --> 01:18:29,497
Well, Justin let it slip to Potter
that he was Muggle-born.

851
01:18:29,664 --> 01:18:33,501
And you definitely think Potter
is the Heir of Slytherin?

852
01:18:33,668 --> 01:18:37,005
Hannah, he's a Parselmouth.

853
01:18:37,172 --> 01:18:39,883
Everyone knows that's the mark
of a dark wizard.

854
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:44,179
Have you ever heard of a decent one
who could talk to snakes?

855
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:47,515
They called Slytherin himself
"Serpent-tongue."

856
01:18:47,682 --> 01:18:50,310
Harry always seemed so nice though.

857
01:18:50,477 --> 01:18:54,981
And after all, he is the one who made
You-Know-Who disappear.

858
01:18:55,273 --> 01:18:59,444
That's probably why You-Know-Who
wanted to kill him in the first place.

859
01:18:59,611 --> 01:19:02,947
Didn't want another Dark Lord
competing with him.

860
01:19:17,545 --> 01:19:19,672
Hello, Harry. You all right?

861
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:22,675
Hagrid. What are you doing here?

862
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:24,928
Second one killed this term.

863
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:28,473
Now, I reckon it's either a fox
or a Blood-Sucking Bugbear.

864
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:31,100
I've been up at Dumbledore's
getting permission...

865
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:33,895
...to put a little charm
round the old hen coop.

866
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:39,234
You sure you're all right?
You're awful hot and bothered.

867
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,027
It's nothing.

868
01:19:41,528 --> 01:19:45,657
Look, I'd better get going.
I've got a lot of studying to...

869
01:20:02,465 --> 01:20:06,719
<i>I want blood.</i>

870
01:20:09,597 --> 01:20:14,602
<i>They all must die.</i>

871
01:20:15,186 --> 01:20:17,188
<i>Kill.</i>

872
01:20:17,856 --> 01:20:19,983
<i>Kill.</i>

873
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:23,027
<i>Kill.</i>

874
01:20:23,361 --> 01:20:27,407
<i>Time to kill.</i>

875
01:21:01,608 --> 01:21:03,568
Caught in the act.

876
01:21:03,735 --> 01:21:05,653
I'll have you out this time, Potter.

877
01:21:06,154 --> 01:21:08,656
Mark my words.

878
01:21:08,823 --> 01:21:13,077
No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand--

879
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:41,773
Professor...

880
01:21:41,940 --> 01:21:43,316
...I swear I didn't.

881
01:21:43,566 --> 01:21:46,778
This is out of my hands, Potter.

882
01:21:56,371 --> 01:21:59,082
Professor Dumbledore
will be waiting for you.

883
01:22:07,966 --> 01:22:10,593
Sherbet Lemon.

884
01:22:44,502 --> 01:22:46,671
Professor Dumbledore?

885
01:23:03,146 --> 01:23:05,857
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?

886
01:23:08,693 --> 01:23:13,239
I was just wondering
if you put me in the right house.

887
01:23:13,406 --> 01:23:18,870
Yes. You were particularly
difficult to place.

888
01:23:19,037 --> 01:23:22,582
But I stand by what I said last year.

889
01:23:22,749 --> 01:23:26,127
You would have done well in Slytherin.

890
01:23:26,294 --> 01:23:27,670
You're wrong.

891
01:23:56,908 --> 01:23:58,326
Harry?

892
01:23:58,743 --> 01:24:00,953
Professor.

893
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:04,916
Your bird...
There was nothing I could do.

894
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:08,836
- He just caught fire.
- And about time too.

895
01:24:09,712 --> 01:24:12,006
He's been looking dreadful for days.

896
01:24:12,215 --> 01:24:14,217
Pity you had to see him on a burning day.

897
01:24:16,094 --> 01:24:19,347
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.

898
01:24:19,514 --> 01:24:22,850
They burst into flame
when it is time for them to die...

899
01:24:23,017 --> 01:24:25,144
...and then they are...

900
01:24:25,311 --> 01:24:28,356
...reborn from the ashes.

901
01:24:36,781 --> 01:24:39,367
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.

902
01:24:39,826 --> 01:24:43,704
They can carry immensely heavy loads.

903
01:24:43,871 --> 01:24:46,749
Their tears have healing powers.

904
01:24:49,335 --> 01:24:52,380
Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Wait! Listen!

905
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:55,508
Professor Dumbledore, sir,
it wasn't Harry.

906
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:58,636
- Hagrid--
- I'd swear it in front of the Ministry.

907
01:24:58,803 --> 01:25:00,638
Hagrid.

908
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:02,890
Relax.

909
01:25:03,641 --> 01:25:05,643
I do not believe...

910
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:10,273
- ...that Harry attacked anyone.
- Of course you don't.

911
01:25:11,065 --> 01:25:12,859
Oh.

912
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:15,653
Right. Well, I'll...

913
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:18,906
- I'll just wait outside, then.
- Yes.

914
01:25:22,577 --> 01:25:26,247
- You don't think it was me, professor?
- No, Harry.

915
01:25:26,414 --> 01:25:28,916
I do not think it was you.

916
01:25:30,001 --> 01:25:31,794
But I must ask you...

917
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:36,424
...is there something
you wish to tell me?

918
01:25:42,972 --> 01:25:44,932
No, sir.

919
01:25:45,099 --> 01:25:46,601
Nothing.

920
01:25:49,604 --> 01:25:51,772
Very well, then.

921
01:25:51,939 --> 01:25:53,691
Off you go.

922
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,504
Hey, look, everyone.
It's the Heir of Slytherin.

923
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:19,926
Be careful.
He's a seriously evil wizard.

924
01:26:20,885 --> 01:26:23,888
Oh, come on, Harry. Fred and George
were just having a laugh.

925
01:26:24,055 --> 01:26:26,265
They're the only ones.

926
01:26:26,432 --> 01:26:30,519
Half the school thinks you're nipping off
to the Chamber of Secrets every night.

927
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:31,771
Who cares?

928
01:26:32,396 --> 01:26:33,856
Maybe they're right.

929
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:39,195
Harry. Harry!

930
01:26:40,404 --> 01:26:41,822
Oh, come on.

931
01:26:41,989 --> 01:26:44,784
Look, I didn't know I could speak
Parseltongue.

932
01:26:45,368 --> 01:26:48,162
What else don't I know about myself?

933
01:26:49,497 --> 01:26:51,082
Look...

934
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:55,461
...maybe you can do something...

935
01:26:55,628 --> 01:26:58,130
...even something horrible...

936
01:26:58,297 --> 01:27:00,174
...and not know you did it.

937
01:27:00,341 --> 01:27:03,719
You don't believe that, Harry.
I know you don't.

938
01:27:04,637 --> 01:27:08,307
And if it makes you feel any better,
Malfoy's staying for the holidays too.

939
01:27:08,975 --> 01:27:11,268
Why would that make
anyone feel any better?

940
01:27:11,435 --> 01:27:15,648
Because in a few days,
the Polyjuice Potion will be ready.

941
01:27:15,815 --> 01:27:18,025
In a few days...

942
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:21,362
...we may truly know
who is the Heir of Slytherin.

943
01:27:47,138 --> 01:27:50,683
Everything's set. We just need a bit
of who you're changing into.

944
01:27:50,850 --> 01:27:52,560
Crabbe and Goyle.

945
01:27:52,727 --> 01:27:55,521
We also need to make sure
that the real Crabbe and Goyle...

946
01:27:55,688 --> 01:27:58,941
...can't burst in on us
while we're interrogating Malfoy.

947
01:27:59,233 --> 01:28:01,986
- How?
- I've got it all worked out.

948
01:28:02,153 --> 01:28:04,697
I filled these
with a simple Sleeping Draught.

949
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:07,658
Simple, but powerful.

950
01:28:07,825 --> 01:28:09,994
Now, once they're asleep...

951
01:28:10,161 --> 01:28:13,372
...hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs...

952
01:28:13,539 --> 01:28:15,416
...and put on their uniforms.

953
01:28:15,583 --> 01:28:18,878
- Whose hair are you ripping out, then?
- I've already got mine.

954
01:28:19,045 --> 01:28:22,214
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.

955
01:28:22,381 --> 01:28:24,550
I got this off her robes.

956
01:28:24,717 --> 01:28:27,344
I'm going to go check
on the Polyjuice Potion.

957
01:28:27,511 --> 01:28:30,222
Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.

958
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:44,737
Ron, maybe I should do it.

959
01:28:44,904 --> 01:28:46,989
Yeah. Right.

960
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,035
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

961
01:29:01,128 --> 01:29:02,755
Cool.

962
01:29:25,903 --> 01:29:27,738
How thick could you get?

963
01:29:27,905 --> 01:29:29,907
Come on, let's get them.

964
01:29:44,839 --> 01:29:47,216
Well, did you get the hairs?

965
01:29:48,425 --> 01:29:49,802
What are those?

966
01:29:49,969 --> 01:29:53,180
Slytherin robes.
I had to sneak them from the laundry.

967
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:56,976
Are we going to drink that?

968
01:29:57,184 --> 01:29:58,227
Mm.

969
01:30:03,107 --> 01:30:07,111
We'll have exactly one hour
before we change back into ourselves.

970
01:30:15,286 --> 01:30:17,204
Add the hairs.

971
01:30:20,666 --> 01:30:23,502
Ugh. Essence of Crabbe.

972
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:25,588
Cheers.

973
01:30:34,305 --> 01:30:36,682
I think I'm gonna be sick.

974
01:30:39,643 --> 01:30:41,478
Me too.

975
01:31:26,357 --> 01:31:28,067
Harry?

976
01:31:28,525 --> 01:31:30,069
Ron.

977
01:31:30,861 --> 01:31:33,030
Bloody hell!

978
01:31:33,781 --> 01:31:36,075
We still sound like ourselves.

979
01:31:36,241 --> 01:31:38,035
You need to sound more like Crabbe.

980
01:31:39,203 --> 01:31:41,455
- Bloody hell.
- Excellent.

981
01:31:41,789 --> 01:31:44,291
- But where's Hermione?
- I...

982
01:31:44,458 --> 01:31:47,461
I don't think I'm going.
You go on without me.

983
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:49,380
Hermione, are you okay?

984
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:52,383
Just go. You're wasting time.

985
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:56,095
Come on.

986
01:31:59,598 --> 01:32:03,477
- The Slytherin common room's this way.
- Okay.

987
01:32:05,938 --> 01:32:08,399
Excuse me.

988
01:32:10,234 --> 01:32:12,111
What are you doing d--?

989
01:32:12,277 --> 01:32:14,405
I mean, what are you doing down here?

990
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:18,993
I happen to be a school prefect.

991
01:32:19,201 --> 01:32:23,622
You, on the other hand, have no business
wandering the corridors at night.

992
01:32:24,248 --> 01:32:26,083
What are your names again?

993
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:30,254
- I'm...
- Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been?

994
01:32:30,421 --> 01:32:33,424
Pigging out in the Great Hall
all this time?

995
01:32:34,925 --> 01:32:37,261
Why are you wearing glasses?

996
01:32:38,095 --> 01:32:40,931
- Reading.
- Reading?

997
01:32:42,099 --> 01:32:44,351
I didn't know you could read.

998
01:32:47,271 --> 01:32:49,314
And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?

999
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:51,525
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.

1000
01:33:00,325 --> 01:33:02,327
Well, sit down.

1001
01:33:05,122 --> 01:33:08,959
You'd never know the Weasleys
were pure-bloods, the way they behave.

1002
01:33:09,168 --> 01:33:13,005
They're an embarrassment
to the wizarding world. All of them.

1003
01:33:13,839 --> 01:33:16,133
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?

1004
01:33:18,343 --> 01:33:20,137
Stomachache.

1005
01:33:22,139 --> 01:33:26,977
I'm surprised the <i>Daily Prophet</i>
hasn't done a report on all these attacks.

1006
01:33:27,144 --> 01:33:29,563
I suppose Dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up.

1007
01:33:29,813 --> 01:33:32,232
Father always said Dumbledore
was the worst thing...

1008
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:36,195
- ...that ever happened to this place.
- You're wrong!

1009
01:33:43,702 --> 01:33:44,870
What?

1010
01:33:45,037 --> 01:33:48,707
You think there's someone here
who's worse than Dumbledore?

1011
01:33:48,874 --> 01:33:51,335
Well? Do you?

1012
01:33:51,835 --> 01:33:53,712
Harry Potter?

1013
01:34:00,302 --> 01:34:01,678
Good one, Goyle.

1014
01:34:01,845 --> 01:34:03,388
You're absolutely right.

1015
01:34:04,056 --> 01:34:05,891
Saint Potter.

1016
01:34:06,892 --> 01:34:09,686
And people actually think
that he's the Heir of Slytherin?

1017
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:16,068
But then you must have some idea
who's behind it all.

1018
01:34:16,235 --> 01:34:19,905
You know I don't, Goyle.
I told you yesterday.

1019
01:34:20,906 --> 01:34:23,408
How many times do I have to tell you?

1020
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:26,245
Is this yours?

1021
01:34:30,707 --> 01:34:33,085
But my father did say this:

1022
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:36,380
It's been 50 years
since the Chamber was opened.

1023
01:34:36,547 --> 01:34:40,926
He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.

1024
01:34:41,218 --> 01:34:45,889
The last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died.

1025
01:34:46,056 --> 01:34:50,394
So it's only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time.

1026
01:34:50,936 --> 01:34:52,771
As for me...

1027
01:34:52,938 --> 01:34:55,107
...I hope it's Granger.

1028
01:34:55,274 --> 01:34:57,484
What's the matter with you two?

1029
01:34:57,651 --> 01:35:00,154
You're acting very odd.

1030
01:35:00,362 --> 01:35:02,573
It's his stomachache.

1031
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:04,783
Calm down.

1032
01:35:08,954 --> 01:35:10,956
Scar.

1033
01:35:14,585 --> 01:35:15,961
Hair.

1034
01:35:22,134 --> 01:35:24,511
Hey! Where are you going?

1035
01:35:47,075 --> 01:35:48,368
That was close.

1036
01:35:48,535 --> 01:35:50,996
Hermione, come out.
We've got loads to tell you.

1037
01:35:51,163 --> 01:35:52,998
Go away.

1038
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:57,377
Wait till you see. It's awful.

1039
01:35:59,338 --> 01:36:01,089
Hermione?

1040
01:36:01,256 --> 01:36:02,883
Are you okay?

1041
01:36:04,968 --> 01:36:06,720
Do you remember me telling you...

1042
01:36:06,887 --> 01:36:10,057
...that the Polyjuice Potion
was only for human transformations?

1043
01:36:10,224 --> 01:36:14,353
It was cat hair I plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes.

1044
01:36:16,730 --> 01:36:18,273
Look at my face.

1045
01:36:19,399 --> 01:36:21,860
Look at your tail.

1046
01:36:28,408 --> 01:36:29,868
Have you spoken to Hermione?

1047
01:36:30,035 --> 01:36:32,579
She should be out of hospital
in a few days...

1048
01:36:32,746 --> 01:36:35,582
...when she stops coughing up fur balls.

1049
01:36:40,379 --> 01:36:42,089
What's this?

1050
01:36:46,718 --> 01:36:47,761
Yuck!

1051
01:36:47,928 --> 01:36:50,722
Looks like Moaning Myrtle's
flooded the bathroom.

1052
01:37:06,947 --> 01:37:11,076
- Come to throw something else at me?
- Why would I throw something at you?

1053
01:37:11,535 --> 01:37:15,580
Don't ask me. Here I am,
minding my own business...

1054
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:19,418
...and someone thinks it's funny
to throw a book at me.

1055
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:22,462
But it can't hurt if someone
throws something at you.

1056
01:37:22,629 --> 01:37:25,090
I mean, it'll just go right through you.

1057
01:37:26,091 --> 01:37:30,470
Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle
because she can't feel it.

1058
01:37:30,637 --> 01:37:33,265
Ten points
if you get it through her stomach!

1059
01:37:33,432 --> 01:37:36,935
Fifty points if it goes through her head!

1060
01:37:37,436 --> 01:37:41,857
- But who threw it at you, anyway?
- I don't know. I didn't see them.

1061
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:46,445
I was just sitting in the U-bend,
thinking about death...

1062
01:37:46,653 --> 01:37:50,324
...and it fell through the top
of my head. Uh-huh.

1063
01:38:09,176 --> 01:38:11,345
There's a name in this diary.

1064
01:38:11,511 --> 01:38:15,974
"Tom Marvolo Riddle."

1065
01:38:16,141 --> 01:38:18,018
Tom Marvolo Riddle?

1066
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:22,647
Hang on. I know that name.

1067
01:38:22,814 --> 01:38:25,317
Why do I know that name?

1068
01:38:25,484 --> 01:38:28,612
Of course. That night I had detention.

1069
01:38:28,779 --> 01:38:31,948
My job was to polish the silver
in the trophy room.

1070
01:38:32,115 --> 01:38:33,742
I remember...

1071
01:38:33,909 --> 01:38:36,995
...because I kept burping up slugs
over Tom Riddle's trophy.

1072
01:38:37,788 --> 01:38:41,583
- What was the trophy for?
- He won an award 50 years ago.

1073
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:44,252
Special services to the school
or something.

1074
01:38:44,419 --> 01:38:46,046
Fifty years ago? Are you sure?

1075
01:38:46,213 --> 01:38:47,631
Yeah. Why?

1076
01:38:48,215 --> 01:38:50,217
Don't you remember what Malfoy told you?

1077
01:38:50,384 --> 01:38:53,095
- Last time the Chamber was opened--
- Fifty years ago.

1078
01:38:53,678 --> 01:38:55,514
- That means--
- Tom Riddle was here...

1079
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:57,724
...at Hogwarts when it happened.

1080
01:38:57,891 --> 01:39:00,560
What if he wrote about what he saw?

1081
01:39:00,727 --> 01:39:04,356
It's possible he knew where
the Chamber was. How to open it.

1082
01:39:04,523 --> 01:39:07,401
Even what sort of creature lives in it.

1083
01:39:07,943 --> 01:39:10,278
If so, whoever's behind these attacks...

1084
01:39:10,445 --> 01:39:13,990
...wouldn't want this diary
lying around, would they?

1085
01:39:14,366 --> 01:39:18,370
It's a brilliant theory, Hermione,
but there's just one flaw.

1086
01:39:19,121 --> 01:39:21,832
There's nothing written in this diary.

1087
01:39:41,309 --> 01:39:43,019
Do you mind?

1088
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:53,113
"Tom Marvolo Riddle."

1089
01:40:22,976 --> 01:40:25,312
My name...

1090
01:40:25,479 --> 01:40:28,398
...is Harry...

1091
01:40:30,025 --> 01:40:32,152
...Potter.

1092
01:40:45,373 --> 01:40:50,545
Do you know anything...

1093
01:40:51,379 --> 01:40:57,469
...about the Chamber of Secrets?

1094
01:41:08,188 --> 01:41:10,106
Can you...

1095
01:41:11,358 --> 01:41:13,693
...tell me?

1096
01:42:15,922 --> 01:42:19,384
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what's going on here?

1097
01:42:22,804 --> 01:42:25,140
Are you Tom Riddle?

1098
01:42:25,307 --> 01:42:27,100
Hello, can you hear me?

1099
01:42:47,662 --> 01:42:49,456
Riddle!

1100
01:42:49,998 --> 01:42:51,541
Come.

1101
01:42:51,708 --> 01:42:53,710
Professor Dumbledore.

1102
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:58,048
Dumbledore?

1103
01:42:59,341 --> 01:43:02,844
It is not wise to be wandering around
this late hour, Tom.

1104
01:43:03,011 --> 01:43:06,348
Yes, professor. I suppose I...

1105
01:43:06,514 --> 01:43:08,683
I had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.

1106
01:43:09,309 --> 01:43:12,187
I'm afraid they are, Tom.
They are true.

1107
01:43:12,354 --> 01:43:15,190
About the school as well?
I don't have a home to go to.

1108
01:43:15,357 --> 01:43:18,193
They wouldn't really close Hogwarts,
would they, professor?

1109
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:20,945
I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid...

1110
01:43:21,696 --> 01:43:24,658
...Headmaster Dippet
may have no choice.

1111
01:43:24,824 --> 01:43:29,329
Sir, if it all stopped,
if the person responsible was caught...

1112
01:43:31,539 --> 01:43:33,667
Is there something...

1113
01:43:34,584 --> 01:43:36,586
...you wish to tell me?

1114
01:43:37,837 --> 01:43:40,340
No, sir. Nothing.

1115
01:43:47,097 --> 01:43:50,183
Very well, then. Off you go.

1116
01:43:50,350 --> 01:43:52,185
Good night, sir.

1117
01:44:28,304 --> 01:44:31,224
- Let's get you out of there.
- Evening, Hagrid.

1118
01:44:31,558 --> 01:44:35,895
I'm going to have to turn you in. I don't
think you meant it to kill anyone...

1119
01:44:36,062 --> 01:44:38,398
You can't. You don't understand.

1120
01:44:38,565 --> 01:44:41,735
The dead girl's parents will be here
tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...

1121
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:44,779
...is make sure the thing that killed
their daughter is slaughtered.

1122
01:44:45,071 --> 01:44:48,158
It wasn't him.
Aragog never killed no one. Never.

1123
01:44:48,533 --> 01:44:50,660
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.

1124
01:44:50,827 --> 01:44:52,454
- Now, stand aside.
- No!

1125
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:54,581
- Stand aside, Hagrid.
- No!

1126
01:44:54,748 --> 01:44:56,416
<i>Cistem Aperio!</i>

1127
01:45:03,339 --> 01:45:05,675
<i>Arania Exumai!</i>

1128
01:45:06,593 --> 01:45:08,011
Aragog!

1129
01:45:08,178 --> 01:45:09,429
Aragog!

1130
01:45:09,971 --> 01:45:11,347
I can't let you go.

1131
01:45:11,931 --> 01:45:15,185
They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
You'll be expelled.

1132
01:45:17,771 --> 01:45:19,606
Hagrid!

1133
01:45:25,153 --> 01:45:29,199
Hagrid!

1134
01:45:41,127 --> 01:45:42,962
Whoa.

1135
01:45:48,051 --> 01:45:51,179
Ron. Ron, wake up.

1136
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:54,390
What? What happened?

1137
01:45:54,557 --> 01:45:58,728
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened
the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.

1138
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:13,743
It was Hagrid.

1139
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:16,621
It can't be Hagrid.
It just can't be.

1140
01:46:16,830 --> 01:46:20,875
We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch.

1141
01:46:21,042 --> 01:46:24,546
The monster had killed somebody, Ron.
What would any of us have done?

1142
01:46:24,879 --> 01:46:28,842
Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't
we just go and ask him about it?

1143
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:31,719
That would be a cheerful visit.
"Hello, Hagrid.

1144
01:46:31,886 --> 01:46:35,723
Tell us, have you been setting anything
mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"

1145
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:39,060
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking
about me, now, would you?

1146
01:46:39,352 --> 01:46:40,395
No.

1147
01:46:44,899 --> 01:46:46,568
What's that you've got, Hagrid?

1148
01:46:46,985 --> 01:46:51,573
It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes, you know.

1149
01:46:51,739 --> 01:46:55,410
Now, according to Professor Sprout,
they've still got a bit of growing to do.

1150
01:46:55,577 --> 01:46:59,080
But once their acne's cleared up,
we'll chop them up and stew them...

1151
01:46:59,247 --> 01:47:02,500
...and then we'll get those people
down at the hospital un-Petrified.

1152
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:06,838
In the meantime, though, you three...

1153
01:47:07,005 --> 01:47:10,174
...had best be looking after yourselves.
All right?

1154
01:47:11,885 --> 01:47:13,803
Hm.

1155
01:47:18,099 --> 01:47:19,976
Hello, Neville.

1156
01:47:21,102 --> 01:47:23,605
Harry, I don't know who did it,
but you'd better come.

1157
01:47:23,938 --> 01:47:25,648
Come on!

1158
01:47:48,212 --> 01:47:52,216
It had to be a Gryffindor.
Nobody else knows our password.

1159
01:47:52,425 --> 01:47:54,636
Unless it wasn't a student.

1160
01:47:54,802 --> 01:47:58,222
Whoever it was, they must have
been looking for something.

1161
01:47:58,431 --> 01:47:59,807
And they found it.

1162
01:48:00,558 --> 01:48:03,061
Tom Riddle's diary is gone.

1163
01:48:04,646 --> 01:48:05,980
All right, listen up.

1164
01:48:06,147 --> 01:48:09,025
We play our game,
Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.

1165
01:48:09,192 --> 01:48:11,069
We're stronger, quicker and smarter.

1166
01:48:11,235 --> 01:48:14,238
Not to mention they're dead scared
that Harry will Petrify them...

1167
01:48:14,447 --> 01:48:17,951
- ...if they fly anywhere near him.
- Well, that too.

1168
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:20,662
Professor McGonagall.

1169
01:48:20,828 --> 01:48:23,873
- This match has been canceled.
- We can't cancel Quidditch.

1170
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:29,003
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates
will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.

1171
01:48:29,170 --> 01:48:31,839
Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley.

1172
01:48:32,215 --> 01:48:34,759
There's something
the both of you have to see.

1173
01:48:36,844 --> 01:48:40,473
I warn you.
This could be a wee bit of a shock.

1174
01:48:48,856 --> 01:48:50,024
Hermione!

1175
01:48:50,191 --> 01:48:53,069
She was found near the library...

1176
01:48:53,236 --> 01:48:55,279
...along with this.

1177
01:48:56,739 --> 01:48:59,575
Does it mean anything to either of you?

1178
01:48:59,742 --> 01:49:01,202
No.

1179
01:49:15,425 --> 01:49:17,760
Could I have your attention, please?

1180
01:49:17,927 --> 01:49:23,558
Because of recent events, these new
rules will be put into effect immediately:

1181
01:49:23,891 --> 01:49:29,063
"All students will return to their house
common rooms by 6:00 every evening.

1182
01:49:29,230 --> 01:49:33,276
All students will be escorted
to each lesson by a teacher.

1183
01:49:33,443 --> 01:49:36,446
No exceptions."

1184
01:49:37,113 --> 01:49:39,157
I should tell you this:

1185
01:49:39,323 --> 01:49:43,453
Unless the culprit
behind these attacks is caught...

1186
01:49:44,037 --> 01:49:47,165
...it is likely the school will be closed.

1187
01:49:58,676 --> 01:50:01,637
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
I can't believe it's him...

1188
01:50:01,804 --> 01:50:04,098
...but if he did set the monster loose
last time...

1189
01:50:04,265 --> 01:50:07,435
...he'll know how to get inside
the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.

1190
01:50:07,602 --> 01:50:08,853
But you heard McGonagall.

1191
01:50:09,062 --> 01:50:12,315
We're not allowed to leave
the tower except for class.

1192
01:50:12,774 --> 01:50:15,276
I think it's time to get
my dad's old cloak out again.

1193
01:50:24,994 --> 01:50:27,246
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1194
01:50:46,891 --> 01:50:48,643
Who's there?

1195
01:50:52,396 --> 01:50:53,981
Hello?

1196
01:50:54,649 --> 01:50:56,150
Hello?

1197
01:50:57,318 --> 01:51:01,656
- What's that for?
- Nothing. I was expecting, uh...

1198
01:51:01,823 --> 01:51:05,660
It doesn't matter. Come on in.
I just made a pot of tea.

1199
01:51:08,412 --> 01:51:10,706
Hagrid, are you okay?

1200
01:51:10,873 --> 01:51:13,751
I'm fine. I'm all right.

1201
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:16,420
Did you hear about Hermione?

1202
01:51:16,921 --> 01:51:20,633
Oh, yeah. I heard about that, all right.

1203
01:51:20,925 --> 01:51:24,637
Look, we have to ask you something.

1204
01:51:26,264 --> 01:51:29,767
Do you know who's opened
the Chamber of Secrets?

1205
01:51:32,144 --> 01:51:34,021
What you had to understand
about that is--

1206
01:51:36,065 --> 01:51:37,692
Quick, under the cloak.

1207
01:51:38,359 --> 01:51:41,404
Don't say a word.
Be quiet, both of you.

1208
01:51:47,869 --> 01:51:50,913
- Professor Dumbledore, sir.
- Good evening, Hagrid.

1209
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:53,541
I wonder, could we...?

1210
01:51:53,708 --> 01:51:56,210
Of course. Come in. Come in.

1211
01:51:56,377 --> 01:51:57,712
That's Dad's boss.

1212
01:51:57,879 --> 01:52:01,465
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.

1213
01:52:01,674 --> 01:52:06,053
Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business.
Had to come.

1214
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:09,432
Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things have gone far enough.

1215
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:12,810
- The Ministry's got to act.
- But I never--

1216
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:14,812
You know I never, professor.

1217
01:52:14,979 --> 01:52:18,065
I want it understood, Cornelius...

1218
01:52:18,232 --> 01:52:20,067
...that Hagrid...

1219
01:52:20,234 --> 01:52:22,570
...has my full confidence.

1220
01:52:22,737 --> 01:52:26,490
Albus, look,
Hagrid's record is against him.

1221
01:52:26,699 --> 01:52:29,243
- I've got to take him.
- Take me?

1222
01:52:29,410 --> 01:52:31,704
Take me where?
Not Azkaban prison.

1223
01:52:31,954 --> 01:52:35,750
I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.

1224
01:52:36,334 --> 01:52:38,252
Already here, Fudge?

1225
01:52:38,419 --> 01:52:39,754
Good.

1226
01:52:40,713 --> 01:52:43,424
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!

1227
01:52:44,091 --> 01:52:45,635
Believe me...

1228
01:52:45,927 --> 01:52:50,139
...I take absolutely no pleasure
being inside your...

1229
01:52:52,016 --> 01:52:54,268
You call this a house?

1230
01:52:55,311 --> 01:52:56,354
No.

1231
01:52:56,520 --> 01:53:00,441
I simply called up the school
and was told the headmaster was here.

1232
01:53:00,608 --> 01:53:04,654
Well, what exactly is it
that you want with me?

1233
01:53:05,237 --> 01:53:09,951
The other governors and I have decided
it's time for you to step aside.

1234
01:53:11,619 --> 01:53:14,497
This is an order of suspension.

1235
01:53:20,044 --> 01:53:23,464
You'll find all 12 signatures on it.

1236
01:53:27,301 --> 01:53:31,514
I'm afraid we feel
you've rather lost your touch.

1237
01:53:32,264 --> 01:53:34,558
Well, what with all these attacks...

1238
01:53:34,767 --> 01:53:37,520
...there'll be no
Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.

1239
01:53:37,687 --> 01:53:42,233
I can only imagine what an awful loss
that would be to the school.

1240
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,652
You can't take
Professor Dumbledore away.

1241
01:53:44,902 --> 01:53:47,488
Take him away and the Muggle-borns
won't stand a chance.

1242
01:53:47,655 --> 01:53:50,074
You mark my words,
there'll be killings next!

1243
01:53:50,282 --> 01:53:51,909
You think so?

1244
01:53:52,076 --> 01:53:54,578
Calm yourself, Hagrid.

1245
01:53:55,913 --> 01:53:58,666
If the governors desire my removal...

1246
01:53:58,833 --> 01:54:02,545
...I will, of course, step aside.

1247
01:54:04,171 --> 01:54:06,382
However...

1248
01:54:07,049 --> 01:54:11,595
...you will find that help
will always be given at Hogwarts...

1249
01:54:11,804 --> 01:54:13,681
...to those who...

1250
01:54:13,848 --> 01:54:16,183
...ask for it.

1251
01:54:22,940 --> 01:54:25,276
Admirable sentiments.

1252
01:54:25,443 --> 01:54:27,319
Shall we?

1253
01:54:39,373 --> 01:54:40,916
Fudge.

1254
01:54:42,626 --> 01:54:44,462
Come, Hagrid.

1255
01:54:45,588 --> 01:54:47,131
Well?

1256
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:48,883
If...

1257
01:54:49,341 --> 01:54:51,886
If anybody was looking for some stuff...

1258
01:54:52,053 --> 01:54:56,891
...then all they'd have to do
would be to follow the spiders.

1259
01:54:57,058 --> 01:54:59,643
Yep. That would lead them right.

1260
01:54:59,852 --> 01:55:01,771
That's all I have to say.

1261
01:55:03,481 --> 01:55:07,234
Oh, and someone will need
to feed Fang while I'm away.

1262
01:55:10,613 --> 01:55:12,615
Good boy.

1263
01:55:18,746 --> 01:55:20,915
Hagrid's right.

1264
01:55:21,082 --> 01:55:24,001
With Dumbledore gone,
there'll be an attack a day.

1265
01:55:24,168 --> 01:55:25,878
Look.

1266
01:55:31,926 --> 01:55:33,677
Come on.

1267
01:55:37,431 --> 01:55:39,433
Come on, Fang.

1268
01:55:57,701 --> 01:55:59,120
Come on.

1269
01:55:59,286 --> 01:56:00,538
What?

1270
01:56:00,704 --> 01:56:03,958
You heard what Hagrid said.
"Follow the spiders."

1271
01:56:04,166 --> 01:56:06,794
They're heading to the Dark Forest.

1272
01:56:08,838 --> 01:56:13,300
Why spiders? Why couldn't it be
"follow the butterflies"?

1273
01:56:46,959 --> 01:56:50,754
There's something
moving over there. Listen.

1274
01:56:51,839 --> 01:56:53,966
- It sounds like something big.
- Big?

1275
01:56:59,305 --> 01:57:02,600
Harry! Harry, it's our car!

1276
01:57:03,642 --> 01:57:07,855
It must've been here all the time.
And, look, the forest has turned it wild.

1277
01:57:10,649 --> 01:57:13,861
Come on.
We don't want to lose the trail.

1278
01:57:27,416 --> 01:57:30,211
Harry, I don't like this.

1279
01:57:35,341 --> 01:57:38,552
- Harry, I don't like this at all.
- Shush!

1280
01:57:50,064 --> 01:57:52,566
Can we go back now?

1281
01:57:52,733 --> 01:57:54,485
Come on.

1282
01:58:44,201 --> 01:58:46,954
Who is it?

1283
01:58:47,621 --> 01:58:48,789
Don't panic.

1284
01:58:49,123 --> 01:58:50,624
Hagrid?

1285
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,626
Is that you?

1286
01:58:53,168 --> 01:58:55,129
We're friends of Hagrid's.

1287
01:59:13,188 --> 01:59:16,442
And you?
You're Aragog, aren't you?

1288
01:59:17,026 --> 01:59:18,319
Yes.

1289
01:59:18,485 --> 01:59:22,323
Hagrid has never sent
men into our hollow before.

1290
01:59:22,489 --> 01:59:25,576
He's in trouble. Up at the school,
there have been attacks.

1291
01:59:26,201 --> 01:59:28,037
They think it's Hagrid.

1292
01:59:28,203 --> 01:59:31,832
They think he opened
the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.

1293
01:59:32,041 --> 01:59:34,376
That's a lie.

1294
01:59:34,835 --> 01:59:37,755
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1295
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:41,258
- Then you're not the monster?
- No.

1296
01:59:41,467 --> 01:59:44,511
The monster was born in the castle.

1297
01:59:44,678 --> 01:59:50,017
I came to Hagrid from a distant land
in the pocket of a traveler.

1298
01:59:50,601 --> 01:59:53,479
- Harry.
- Shush.

1299
01:59:54,188 --> 01:59:58,734
But if you're not the monster, then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago?

1300
01:59:58,901 --> 02:00:01,904
We do not speak of it.

1301
02:00:02,237 --> 02:00:07,785
It is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others.

1302
02:00:07,993 --> 02:00:09,745
But have you seen it?

1303
02:00:10,412 --> 02:00:16,251
I never saw any part of the
castle but the box in which I was kept.

1304
02:00:16,418 --> 02:00:19,588
The girl was discovered in a bathroom.

1305
02:00:19,755 --> 02:00:24,259
When I was accused,
Hagrid brought me here.

1306
02:00:24,426 --> 02:00:26,428
- Harry!
- What?

1307
02:00:39,274 --> 02:00:42,277
Well, thank you.

1308
02:00:43,237 --> 02:00:45,406
We'll just go.

1309
02:00:45,906 --> 02:00:47,616
Go?

1310
02:00:47,825 --> 02:00:49,618
I think not.

1311
02:00:49,785 --> 02:00:55,249
My sons and daughters
do not harm Hagrid on my command.

1312
02:00:55,416 --> 02:00:57,835
But I cannot deny them fresh meat...

1313
02:00:58,043 --> 02:01:02,339
...when it wanders
so willingly into our midst.

1314
02:01:02,548 --> 02:01:06,301
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.

1315
02:01:06,468 --> 02:01:08,303
Can we panic now?

1316
02:01:19,064 --> 02:01:20,941
Know any spells?

1317
02:01:21,108 --> 02:01:24,278
One, but it's not powerful
enough for all of them.

1318
02:01:24,445 --> 02:01:27,197
Where's Hermione when you need her?

1319
02:01:40,711 --> 02:01:42,004
Let's go!

1320
02:01:47,134 --> 02:01:49,219
<i>Arania Exumai!</i>

1321
02:01:54,516 --> 02:01:55,851
Go!

1322
02:02:06,820 --> 02:02:08,155
Whoa!

1323
02:02:13,827 --> 02:02:15,913
Glad we're out of there.

1324
02:02:22,878 --> 02:02:25,214
<i>Arania Exumai!</i>

1325
02:02:30,928 --> 02:02:34,681
- Thanks for that.
- Don't mention it.

1326
02:02:45,651 --> 02:02:47,778
Get us out of here.

1327
02:02:48,278 --> 02:02:49,947
Now!

1328
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:56,286
Come on!
Come on, move faster!

1329
02:02:58,956 --> 02:03:00,290
Come on! Go!

1330
02:03:17,808 --> 02:03:19,893
Get us in the air.

1331
02:03:20,936 --> 02:03:22,396
The flying gear's jammed!

1332
02:03:26,483 --> 02:03:30,279
- Come on! Pull!
- I'm trying!

1333
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:02,519
Follow the spiders.
Follow the spiders.

1334
02:04:02,728 --> 02:04:07,024
If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban,
I'll kill him.

1335
02:04:21,038 --> 02:04:24,291
I mean, what was the point
of sending us in there?

1336
02:04:24,458 --> 02:04:29,046
- What have we found out?
- We know one thing.

1337
02:04:29,254 --> 02:04:32,633
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1338
02:04:32,799 --> 02:04:34,801
He was innocent.

1339
02:04:50,317 --> 02:04:52,778
Wish you were here, Hermione.

1340
02:04:53,320 --> 02:04:55,572
We need you.

1341
02:04:56,490 --> 02:04:58,575
Now more than ever.

1342
02:05:15,509 --> 02:05:18,929
- What's that?
- Ron...

1343
02:05:19,805 --> 02:05:24,226
This is why Hermione was in
the library the day she was attacked.

1344
02:05:24,810 --> 02:05:26,019
Come on.

1345
02:05:26,687 --> 02:05:29,690
"Of the many fearsome beasts
that roam our land...

1346
02:05:29,856 --> 02:05:34,444
...none is more deadly than the basilisk.
Capable of living for hundreds of years...

1347
02:05:34,611 --> 02:05:38,407
...instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye.

1348
02:05:38,573 --> 02:05:41,576
Spiders flee before it."
Ron, this is it.

1349
02:05:41,743 --> 02:05:44,538
The monster in the
Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk.

1350
02:05:44,705 --> 02:05:48,625
That's why I can hear it speak.
It's a snake.

1351
02:05:48,959 --> 02:05:54,256
But if it kills by looking people
in the eye, why is it no one's dead?

1352
02:06:04,891 --> 02:06:07,853
Because no one did look it in the eye.

1353
02:06:09,771 --> 02:06:12,399
Not directly, at least.

1354
02:06:13,608 --> 02:06:15,819
Colin saw it through his camera.

1355
02:06:15,986 --> 02:06:20,073
Justin-- Justin must have seen the
basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.

1356
02:06:20,240 --> 02:06:24,244
Nick got the full blast of it.
But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.

1357
02:06:24,411 --> 02:06:27,497
And Hermione had the mirror.

1358
02:06:27,664 --> 02:06:31,084
I bet you she was using it to look
around corners in case it came along.

1359
02:06:31,251 --> 02:06:32,502
And Mrs. Norris?

1360
02:06:32,669 --> 02:06:36,173
I'm pretty sure she didn't have
a camera or a mirror, Harry.

1361
02:06:37,758 --> 02:06:39,593
The water.

1362
02:06:40,093 --> 02:06:45,640
There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk's reflection.

1363
02:06:51,772 --> 02:06:53,690
"Spiders flee before it."

1364
02:06:53,899 --> 02:06:57,611
- It all fits.
- How's the basilisk been getting around?

1365
02:06:57,778 --> 02:07:00,614
A dirty, great snake.
Someone would have seen it.

1366
02:07:00,781 --> 02:07:06,453
- Hermione's answered that too.
- Pipes? It's using the plumbing.

1367
02:07:06,620 --> 02:07:10,874
Remember what Aragog said
about that girl 50 years ago?

1368
02:07:11,041 --> 02:07:15,295
She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?

1369
02:07:15,962 --> 02:07:17,297
Moaning Myrtle.

1370
02:07:18,298 --> 02:07:22,302
<i>All students are to
return to their dormitories at once.</i>

1371
02:07:22,469 --> 02:07:25,931
<i>All teachers to the second-floor
corridor immediately.</i>

1372
02:07:30,936 --> 02:07:36,733
As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin
has left another message.

1373
02:07:36,942 --> 02:07:39,152
Our worst fear has been realized.

1374
02:07:39,319 --> 02:07:43,865
A student has been taken by the monster
into the Chamber itself.

1375
02:07:44,950 --> 02:07:50,580
The students must be sent home.
I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.

1376
02:07:52,999 --> 02:07:55,418
So sorry. Dozed off.
What have I missed?

1377
02:07:55,585 --> 02:07:59,923
A girl has been snatched by the monster,
Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.

1378
02:08:00,090 --> 02:08:03,051
- My moment?
- Weren't you saying just last night...

1379
02:08:03,218 --> 02:08:07,764
...that you've known all along where the
entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?

1380
02:08:09,099 --> 02:08:14,604
That's settled. We'll leave you
to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.

1381
02:08:14,771 --> 02:08:19,943
- Your skills, after all, are legend.
- Very well.

1382
02:08:20,110 --> 02:08:23,363
I'll just be in my office getting...

1383
02:08:24,197 --> 02:08:26,116
Getting ready.

1384
02:08:29,035 --> 02:08:32,247
Who is it that the monster's taken,
Minerva?

1385
02:08:32,414 --> 02:08:34,249
Ginny Weasley.

1386
02:08:45,635 --> 02:08:48,722
"Her skeleton will lie
in the Chamber forever."

1387
02:08:52,767 --> 02:08:54,561
Ginny.

1388
02:08:56,646 --> 02:09:00,150
Lockhart's useless, but he's
going to try and get into the Chamber.

1389
02:09:00,317 --> 02:09:03,069
At least we can tell him what we know.

1390
02:09:04,404 --> 02:09:06,948
Professor, we have some information
for you.

1391
02:09:08,742 --> 02:09:10,660
Are you going somewhere?

1392
02:09:10,827 --> 02:09:13,955
Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.
Got to go.

1393
02:09:14,122 --> 02:09:17,334
- What about my sister?
- Well...

1394
02:09:17,667 --> 02:09:21,171
As to that, most unfortunate.
No one regrets more than I.

1395
02:09:21,338 --> 02:09:25,342
You're the Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher. You can't go now.

1396
02:09:25,550 --> 02:09:28,511
I must say, when I took the job,
there was nothing in the description--

1397
02:09:28,678 --> 02:09:29,846
You're running away?

1398
02:09:30,055 --> 02:09:32,807
- After all you did in your books?
- Books can be misleading.

1399
02:09:32,974 --> 02:09:35,518
- You wrote them.
- My dear boy, use your common sense.

1400
02:09:35,685 --> 02:09:40,106
My books wouldn't have sold as well if
people didn't think I'd done those things.

1401
02:09:40,690 --> 02:09:42,275
You're a fraud.

1402
02:09:42,442 --> 02:09:45,278
You've been taking credit
for what other wizards have done.

1403
02:09:45,445 --> 02:09:47,364
Is there anything you can do?

1404
02:09:47,572 --> 02:09:52,285
Yes, now you mention it.
I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.

1405
02:09:52,452 --> 02:09:54,955
Otherwise, all those wizards
would have gone blabbing.

1406
02:09:55,121 --> 02:09:58,208
I'd never have sold another book.

1407
02:09:58,375 --> 02:10:04,130
In fact, I'm going to have to do
the same to you.

1408
02:10:04,631 --> 02:10:07,384
Don't even think about it.

1409
02:10:18,228 --> 02:10:19,688
Who's there?

1410
02:10:22,148 --> 02:10:24,150
Hello, Harry.

1411
02:10:25,110 --> 02:10:30,240
- What do you want?
- To ask you how you died.

1412
02:10:32,659 --> 02:10:35,078
It was dreadful.

1413
02:10:35,245 --> 02:10:38,915
It happened right here
in this very cubicle.

1414
02:10:39,124 --> 02:10:43,169
I'd hidden because Olive Hornby
was teasing me about my glasses.

1415
02:10:43,336 --> 02:10:48,216
I was crying, and then
I heard somebody come in.

1416
02:10:48,383 --> 02:10:54,723
- Who was it, Myrtle?
- I don't know. I was distraught!

1417
02:10:56,016 --> 02:10:59,436
But they said something funny,
a kind of made-up language.

1418
02:10:59,644 --> 02:11:05,942
And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked
the door to tell him to go away and...

1419
02:11:07,152 --> 02:11:11,948
- ...I died.
- Just like that? How?

1420
02:11:12,157 --> 02:11:16,619
I just remember seeing a pair
of great, big, yellow eyes...

1421
02:11:16,786 --> 02:11:20,665
...over there by that sink.

1422
02:11:45,732 --> 02:11:47,776
This is it.

1423
02:11:48,693 --> 02:11:53,490
This is it, Ron. I think this is
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.

1424
02:11:55,492 --> 02:12:00,330
Say something. Harry,
say something in Parseltongue.

1425
02:12:51,881 --> 02:12:55,969
Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Well, then, I'll just be...

1426
02:12:56,136 --> 02:12:58,388
There's no need for me to stay.

1427
02:12:59,013 --> 02:13:00,890
Yes, there is.

1428
02:13:02,767 --> 02:13:05,812
- You first.
- Now, boys, what good will it do?

1429
02:13:05,979 --> 02:13:07,313
Better you than us.

1430
02:13:08,523 --> 02:13:11,484
But-- Obviously, yes.

1431
02:13:15,780 --> 02:13:18,491
Sure you don't want to test it first?

1432
02:13:25,290 --> 02:13:28,501
It's really quite filthy down here.

1433
02:13:29,002 --> 02:13:33,506
- All right. Let's go.
- Oh, Harry?

1434
02:13:33,923 --> 02:13:38,845
If you die down there,
you're welcome to share my toilet.

1435
02:13:41,389 --> 02:13:43,349
Thanks, Myrtle.

1436
02:14:08,541 --> 02:14:10,376
Ugh.

1437
02:14:12,462 --> 02:14:17,634
Now, remember: Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straightaway.

1438
02:14:18,593 --> 02:14:20,261
Go on.

1439
02:14:23,973 --> 02:14:25,350
This way.

1440
02:14:32,357 --> 02:14:37,570
- What's this?
- It looks like a snake.

1441
02:14:37,737 --> 02:14:41,407
- It's a snakeskin.
- Bloody hell.

1442
02:14:41,574 --> 02:14:47,413
Whatever shed this must be
60 feet long. Or more.

1443
02:14:49,290 --> 02:14:52,252
Heart of a lion, this one.

1444
02:14:55,964 --> 02:15:00,635
The adventure ends here, boys.
But don't fret.

1445
02:15:02,595 --> 02:15:08,017
The world will know our story.
How I was too late to save the girl.

1446
02:15:08,393 --> 02:15:11,854
How you two tragically lost your minds...

1447
02:15:12,021 --> 02:15:15,024
...at the sight of her mangled body.

1448
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:17,318
So...

1449
02:15:18,444 --> 02:15:20,780
You first, Mr. Potter.

1450
02:15:21,030 --> 02:15:24,200
Say goodbye to your memories.

1451
02:15:26,286 --> 02:15:28,204
<i>Obliviate!</i>

1452
02:15:54,939 --> 02:15:57,066
Harry.

1453
02:15:57,817 --> 02:15:59,944
Harry.

1454
02:16:02,155 --> 02:16:05,241
- Ron! Ron, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1455
02:16:08,995 --> 02:16:10,747
Hello.

1456
02:16:11,456 --> 02:16:13,249
Who are you?

1457
02:16:14,667 --> 02:16:17,337
- Ron Weasley.
- Really?

1458
02:16:17,503 --> 02:16:20,340
And who am I?

1459
02:16:22,091 --> 02:16:26,471
Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
He hasn't got a clue who he is.

1460
02:16:26,763 --> 02:16:31,267
It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?

1461
02:16:31,476 --> 02:16:33,561
Do you live here?

1462
02:16:34,270 --> 02:16:36,773
- No.
- Really?

1463
02:16:41,361 --> 02:16:43,196
- What do I do now?
- You wait here...

1464
02:16:43,363 --> 02:16:46,282
...and try and shift some of this rock
so we can get back through.

1465
02:16:46,491 --> 02:16:50,119
- I'll go on and find Ginny.
- Okay.

1466
02:18:13,953 --> 02:18:15,788
Ginny.

1467
02:18:23,337 --> 02:18:27,216
Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead.
Wake up, wake up.

1468
02:18:27,717 --> 02:18:29,802
Please wake up.

1469
02:18:30,094 --> 02:18:32,221
She won't wake.

1470
02:18:37,685 --> 02:18:42,023
Tom. Tom Riddle.
What do you mean, she won't wake?

1471
02:18:42,190 --> 02:18:45,610
- She's not...?
- She's still alive, but only just.

1472
02:18:46,611 --> 02:18:48,863
- Are you a ghost?
- A memory...

1473
02:18:49,030 --> 02:18:51,407
...preserved in a diary for 50 years.

1474
02:18:54,118 --> 02:18:59,332
She's cold as ice.
Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.

1475
02:18:59,499 --> 02:19:01,876
You've got to help me, Tom.
There's a basilisk.

1476
02:19:02,043 --> 02:19:04,670
It won't come until it's called.

1477
02:19:07,423 --> 02:19:10,259
- Give me my wand, Tom.
- You won't be needing it.

1478
02:19:11,344 --> 02:19:14,722
- We've got to go. We've got to save her.
- I'm afraid I can't do that.

1479
02:19:14,889 --> 02:19:18,935
You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker,
I grow stronger.

1480
02:19:20,269 --> 02:19:24,774
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

1481
02:19:24,941 --> 02:19:27,276
No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.

1482
02:19:27,443 --> 02:19:30,696
Ginny set the basilisk
on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...

1483
02:19:30,863 --> 02:19:33,282
...Ginny wrote the threatening
messages on the walls.

1484
02:19:33,449 --> 02:19:36,744
- But why?
- Because I told her to.

1485
02:19:36,911 --> 02:19:41,874
You'll find I can be very persuasive.
Not that she knew what she was doing.

1486
02:19:42,041 --> 02:19:45,378
She was, shall we say,
in a kind of trance.

1487
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:48,422
Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her.

1488
02:19:48,589 --> 02:19:50,967
She tried to dispose of it
in the girls' bathroom.

1489
02:19:51,175 --> 02:19:55,471
And then who should find it but you?

1490
02:19:55,680 --> 02:19:58,766
The very person
I was most anxious to meet.

1491
02:19:59,392 --> 02:20:01,435
And why did you want to meet me?

1492
02:20:01,811 --> 02:20:05,231
I knew I had to talk to you,
meet you if I could.

1493
02:20:05,398 --> 02:20:08,651
So I decided to show you my capture
of that brainless oaf Hagrid...

1494
02:20:08,818 --> 02:20:11,988
- ...to gain your trust.
- Hagrid's my friend.

1495
02:20:12,905 --> 02:20:17,493
- And you framed him, didn't you?
- It was my word against Hagrid's.

1496
02:20:17,702 --> 02:20:20,955
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
he was innocent.

1497
02:20:21,122 --> 02:20:23,291
I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.

1498
02:20:23,457 --> 02:20:26,919
He certainly kept an annoyingly close
watch on me after that.

1499
02:20:27,086 --> 02:20:30,423
I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the
Chamber again while I was at school...

1500
02:20:30,590 --> 02:20:32,425
...so I decided to leave behind
a diary...

1501
02:20:32,592 --> 02:20:34,677
...preserving my 16-year-old self
in its pages...

1502
02:20:34,844 --> 02:20:37,513
...so that one day
I would be able to lead another...

1503
02:20:37,722 --> 02:20:40,516
...to finish Salazar Slytherin's
noble work.

1504
02:20:40,725 --> 02:20:42,935
Well, you haven't finished it this time.

1505
02:20:43,102 --> 02:20:46,105
In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught
will be ready.

1506
02:20:46,272 --> 02:20:48,983
And everyone who was Petrified
will be all right again.

1507
02:20:49,358 --> 02:20:54,614
Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods
doesn't matter to me anymore.

1508
02:20:54,864 --> 02:20:59,660
For many months now,
my new target has been you.

1509
02:21:01,120 --> 02:21:04,749
How is it that a baby
with no extraordinary magical talent...

1510
02:21:04,915 --> 02:21:07,543
...was able to defeat the greatest wizard
of all time?

1511
02:21:07,877 --> 02:21:10,838
How did you escape with nothing
but a scar...

1512
02:21:11,005 --> 02:21:13,382
...while Lord Voldemort's powers
were destroyed?

1513
02:21:13,549 --> 02:21:17,762
Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.

1514
02:21:17,928 --> 02:21:24,393
Voldemort is my past,
present and future.

1515
02:21:44,830 --> 02:21:48,292
You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.

1516
02:21:51,420 --> 02:21:55,007
- You're Voldemort.
- Surely you didn't think...

1517
02:21:55,174 --> 02:21:59,679
...I was going to keep
my filthy Muggle father's name?

1518
02:21:59,845 --> 02:22:04,016
No. I fashioned myself a new name,
a name I knew wizards everywhere...

1519
02:22:04,183 --> 02:22:08,396
...would fear to speak when I became
the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1520
02:22:08,562 --> 02:22:11,732
Albus Dumbledore
is the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1521
02:22:11,899 --> 02:22:15,319
Dumbledore's been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of me.

1522
02:22:15,528 --> 02:22:20,533
He'll never be gone. Not as long as
those who remain are loyal to him.

1523
02:22:26,914 --> 02:22:27,957
Fawkes?

1524
02:22:44,223 --> 02:22:47,810
So this is what Dumbledore
sends his great defender.

1525
02:22:47,977 --> 02:22:51,647
A songbird and an old hat.

1526
02:23:04,952 --> 02:23:09,498
Let's match the power of Lord
Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin...

1527
02:23:09,665 --> 02:23:13,669
...against the famous Harry Potter.

1528
02:23:27,016 --> 02:23:31,395
Parseltongue won't save you now,
Potter. It only obeys me.

1529
02:24:01,550 --> 02:24:03,135
No!

1530
02:24:03,552 --> 02:24:08,057
Your bird may have blinded the basilisk,
but it can still hear you.

1531
02:25:50,075 --> 02:25:53,329
Yes, Potter.
The process is nearly complete.

1532
02:25:53,537 --> 02:25:58,417
In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead, and I will cease to be a memory.

1533
02:25:58,584 --> 02:26:01,253
Lord Voldemort will return...

1534
02:26:01,629 --> 02:26:05,841
...very much alive.

1535
02:26:06,592 --> 02:26:07,968
Ginny?

1536
02:28:24,313 --> 02:28:25,898
Remarkable, isn't it...

1537
02:28:26,065 --> 02:28:30,069
...how quickly the venom
of the basilisk penetrates the body?

1538
02:28:30,235 --> 02:28:32,905
I'd guess you have little more
than a minute to live.

1539
02:28:33,238 --> 02:28:37,284
You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry.

1540
02:28:42,289 --> 02:28:45,959
Funny, the damage a silly
little book can do...

1541
02:28:46,126 --> 02:28:51,215
...especially in the hands
of a silly little girl.

1542
02:28:54,009 --> 02:28:55,844
What are you doing?

1543
02:28:58,722 --> 02:29:00,808
Stop. No!

1544
02:29:53,485 --> 02:29:55,404
Ginny.

1545
02:29:57,156 --> 02:29:58,907
Harry.

1546
02:29:59,074 --> 02:30:03,078
It was me.
But I swear, I didn't mean to.

1547
02:30:03,287 --> 02:30:06,790
Riddle made me, and...

1548
02:30:07,291 --> 02:30:09,918
Harry, you're hurt.

1549
02:30:10,294 --> 02:30:11,753
Don't worry.

1550
02:30:11,920 --> 02:30:15,591
Ginny, you need to get yourself out.

1551
02:30:15,799 --> 02:30:19,011
Follow the Chamber and you'll find Ron.

1552
02:30:31,190 --> 02:30:33,317
You were brilliant, Fawkes.

1553
02:30:34,401 --> 02:30:36,862
I just wasn't quick enough.

1554
02:30:57,633 --> 02:30:59,384
Of course.

1555
02:30:59,635 --> 02:31:02,471
Phoenix tears have healing powers.

1556
02:31:04,097 --> 02:31:05,891
Thanks.

1557
02:31:07,643 --> 02:31:09,770
It's all right, Ginny.

1558
02:31:10,896 --> 02:31:13,106
It's over.

1559
02:31:14,107 --> 02:31:16,652
It's just a memory.

1560
02:31:19,571 --> 02:31:24,910
Amazing!
This is just like magic!

1561
02:31:36,171 --> 02:31:38,840
You both realize, of course...

1562
02:31:39,007 --> 02:31:44,513
...that in the past few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules.

1563
02:31:45,138 --> 02:31:46,181
Yes, sir.

1564
02:31:46,390 --> 02:31:49,601
There is sufficient evidence
to have you both expelled.

1565
02:31:49,768 --> 02:31:50,936
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1566
02:31:51,103 --> 02:31:53,897
Therefore, it is only fitting...

1567
02:31:55,440 --> 02:31:57,693
...that you both receive...

1568
02:31:58,193 --> 02:32:02,281
...Special Awards for Services
to the School.

1569
02:32:04,408 --> 02:32:06,201
Thanks, sir.

1570
02:32:06,785 --> 02:32:09,121
Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would...

1571
02:32:09,288 --> 02:32:13,458
...have an owl deliver these
release papers to Azkaban.

1572
02:32:14,543 --> 02:32:19,298
I believe we want our gamekeeper back.

1573
02:32:22,009 --> 02:32:23,969
Harry.

1574
02:32:24,303 --> 02:32:28,640
First, I want to thank you, Harry.

1575
02:32:29,224 --> 02:32:32,728
You must have shown me
real loyalty down in the Chamber.

1576
02:32:33,645 --> 02:32:38,191
Nothing but that
could have called Fawkes to you.

1577
02:32:40,569 --> 02:32:42,154
And...

1578
02:32:42,696 --> 02:32:44,156
...second...

1579
02:32:44,323 --> 02:32:49,077
...I sense that something
is troubling you.

1580
02:32:49,328 --> 02:32:51,830
Am I right, Harry?

1581
02:32:53,665 --> 02:32:55,375
It's just...

1582
02:32:56,543 --> 02:33:01,256
You see, sir, I couldn't help
but notice certain things, certain...

1583
02:33:01,465 --> 02:33:07,095
Certain similarities
between Tom Riddle and me.

1584
02:33:07,679 --> 02:33:08,847
I see.

1585
02:33:09,014 --> 02:33:14,853
Well, you can speak
Parseltongue, Harry. Why?

1586
02:33:15,270 --> 02:33:20,776
Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parseltongue.

1587
02:33:22,027 --> 02:33:24,738
If I'm not mistaken, Harry...

1588
02:33:25,113 --> 02:33:28,950
...he transferred
some of his powers to you...

1589
02:33:29,117 --> 02:33:32,079
...the night he gave you that scar.

1590
02:33:32,245 --> 02:33:36,124
Voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me?

1591
02:33:36,375 --> 02:33:37,876
Uh-huh.

1592
02:33:38,043 --> 02:33:40,754
Not intentionally...

1593
02:33:41,630 --> 02:33:43,548
...but yes.

1594
02:33:45,509 --> 02:33:48,804
So the Sorting Hat was right.
I should be in Slytherin.

1595
02:33:49,012 --> 02:33:53,809
It's true. You possess many of the
qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.

1596
02:33:54,017 --> 02:33:56,812
Determination, resourcefulness...

1597
02:33:57,020 --> 02:34:01,024
...and if I may say so,
a certain disregard for the rules.

1598
02:34:01,733 --> 02:34:05,737
Why, then, did the Sorting Hat
place you in Gryffindor?

1599
02:34:06,571 --> 02:34:10,242
- Because I asked it to.
- Exactly, Harry. Exactly.

1600
02:34:10,409 --> 02:34:12,452
Which makes you different from Voldemort.

1601
02:34:12,619 --> 02:34:16,540
It is not our abilities
that show what we truly are.

1602
02:34:16,790 --> 02:34:18,917
It is our choices.

1603
02:34:22,587 --> 02:34:26,007
If you want proof
why you belong in Gryffindor...

1604
02:34:26,174 --> 02:34:31,096
...then I suggest
you look more closely at this.

1605
02:34:32,097 --> 02:34:33,765
Be careful.

1606
02:34:39,438 --> 02:34:42,107
Godric Gryffindor.

1607
02:34:42,274 --> 02:34:46,319
It would take a true Gryffindor
to pull that out of the hat.

1608
02:34:55,203 --> 02:34:56,621
Dobby.

1609
02:34:57,873 --> 02:35:02,294
So this is your master.
The family you serve is the Malfoys.

1610
02:35:04,463 --> 02:35:07,799
I'll deal with you later.

1611
02:35:13,638 --> 02:35:15,223
Out of my way, Potter.

1612
02:35:15,390 --> 02:35:18,977
So it's true. You have returned.

1613
02:35:19,644 --> 02:35:22,481
When the governors learned that
Arthur Weasley's daughter...

1614
02:35:22,647 --> 02:35:26,818
...was taken into the Chamber,
they saw fit to summon me back.

1615
02:35:27,652 --> 02:35:28,987
Ridiculous.

1616
02:35:29,154 --> 02:35:31,656
Curiously, Lucius, several of them...

1617
02:35:31,865 --> 02:35:35,535
...were under the impression
that you would curse their families...

1618
02:35:35,702 --> 02:35:38,538
...if they did not agree
to suspend me in the first place.

1619
02:35:38,997 --> 02:35:42,501
- How dare you!
- Beg your pardon?

1620
02:35:42,667 --> 02:35:46,421
My sole concern has always been
and will always be...

1621
02:35:46,630 --> 02:35:49,424
...the welfare of this school...

1622
02:35:49,633 --> 02:35:53,887
...and, of course, its students.

1623
02:35:57,933 --> 02:36:02,187
The culprit has been identified,
I presume?

1624
02:36:02,521 --> 02:36:04,064
Oh, yes.

1625
02:36:05,690 --> 02:36:07,526
And?

1626
02:36:08,693 --> 02:36:10,695
Who was it?

1627
02:36:17,160 --> 02:36:20,539
- Voldemort.
- Ah.

1628
02:36:20,872 --> 02:36:26,294
Only this time he chose to act
through somebody else...

1629
02:36:26,878 --> 02:36:30,465
...by means of this.

1630
02:36:33,176 --> 02:36:34,719
I see.

1631
02:36:36,179 --> 02:36:40,392
Fortunately,
our young Mr. Potter discovered it.

1632
02:36:40,725 --> 02:36:44,396
One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort's old school-things...

1633
02:36:44,563 --> 02:36:47,774
...should find their way
into innocent hands.

1634
02:36:48,108 --> 02:36:52,070
The consequences for the one
responsible would be...

1635
02:36:52,404 --> 02:36:54,281
...severe.

1636
02:36:55,740 --> 02:36:58,493
Well, let us hope...

1637
02:36:58,702 --> 02:37:04,249
...that Mr. Potter will always
be around to save the day.

1638
02:37:04,958 --> 02:37:08,753
Don't worry. I will be.

1639
02:37:17,470 --> 02:37:19,514
Dumbledore.

1640
02:37:20,640 --> 02:37:24,227
Come, Dobby. We're leaving.

1641
02:37:41,453 --> 02:37:45,957
Sir?
I wonder if I could have that?

1642
02:37:52,339 --> 02:37:53,965
Mr. Malfoy.

1643
02:37:54,132 --> 02:37:56,301
Mr. Malfoy!

1644
02:37:56,801 --> 02:37:58,970
I have something of yours.

1645
02:38:00,639 --> 02:38:03,558
Mine? I don't know
what you're talking about.

1646
02:38:03,767 --> 02:38:05,310
Oh, I think you do, sir.

1647
02:38:05,477 --> 02:38:08,563
I think you slipped the diary
into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...

1648
02:38:08,772 --> 02:38:10,148
...that day at Diagon Alley.

1649
02:38:10,857 --> 02:38:13,401
You do, do you?

1650
02:38:20,784 --> 02:38:23,828
Why don't you prove it?

1651
02:38:30,085 --> 02:38:32,295
Come, Dobby.

1652
02:38:33,546 --> 02:38:35,590
Open it.

1653
02:38:39,094 --> 02:38:40,679
Dobby.

1654
02:38:40,845 --> 02:38:44,015
Master has given Dobby a sock.

1655
02:38:44,307 --> 02:38:46,351
What? I didn't give--

1656
02:38:46,518 --> 02:38:50,230
Master has presented Dobby with clothes.

1657
02:38:50,397 --> 02:38:53,441
Dobby is free.

1658
02:39:00,031 --> 02:39:03,743
You lost me my servant!

1659
02:39:10,709 --> 02:39:14,713
You shall not harm Harry Potter.

1660
02:39:23,763 --> 02:39:24,848
Hm.

1661
02:39:26,891 --> 02:39:30,562
Your parents were meddlesome fools too.

1662
02:39:30,729 --> 02:39:33,898
Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon...

1663
02:39:34,065 --> 02:39:39,279
...you are going to meet
the same sticky end.

1664
02:39:44,993 --> 02:39:50,915
Harry Potter freed Dobby.
How can Dobby ever repay him?

1665
02:39:51,249 --> 02:39:55,503
- Just promise me something.
- Anything, sir.

1666
02:39:57,464 --> 02:39:59,924
Never try to save my life again.

1667
02:40:06,097 --> 02:40:09,100
- Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.

1668
02:40:09,392 --> 02:40:11,770
- Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
- Good evening.

1669
02:40:11,936 --> 02:40:14,814
- Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.

1670
02:40:16,191 --> 02:40:18,443
Hello.

1671
02:40:20,111 --> 02:40:24,783
- Hermione! Welcome back.
- Thanks, Sir Nicholas.

1672
02:40:27,994 --> 02:40:31,331
Harry. It's Hermione.

1673
02:40:52,685 --> 02:40:57,315
Uh, um, ahem.

1674
02:40:58,149 --> 02:41:01,861
- Welcome back, Hermione.
- It's good to be back.

1675
02:41:02,028 --> 02:41:04,656
Congratulations.
I can't believe you solved it.

1676
02:41:04,823 --> 02:41:07,033
We had loads of help from you.

1677
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:10,411
- We couldn't have done it without you.
- Thanks.

1678
02:41:12,247 --> 02:41:15,208
Could I have your attention, please?

1679
02:41:19,379 --> 02:41:21,881
Before we begin the feast...

1680
02:41:22,048 --> 02:41:28,346
...let us have a round of applause
for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...

1681
02:41:28,513 --> 02:41:32,600
...whose Mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered...

1682
02:41:32,767 --> 02:41:35,478
...to all who had been Petrified.

1683
02:41:45,989 --> 02:41:48,950
Also, in light of the recent events...

1684
02:41:49,117 --> 02:41:51,286
...as a school treat...

1685
02:41:51,494 --> 02:41:55,415
...all exams have been canceled.

1686
02:41:58,084 --> 02:41:59,711
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1687
02:42:16,603 --> 02:42:18,646
Sorry I'm late.

1688
02:42:24,736 --> 02:42:29,115
The owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and confused.

1689
02:42:29,449 --> 02:42:32,744
Some ruddy bird called Errol.

1690
02:42:48,551 --> 02:42:54,557
And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't
been for you, Harry, and Ron...

1691
02:42:54,766 --> 02:42:57,685
...and Hermione, of course...

1692
02:42:58,353 --> 02:43:02,440
...I would still be you-know-where...

1693
02:43:02,607 --> 02:43:06,194
...so I'd just like to say thanks.

1694
02:43:15,620 --> 02:43:18,581
There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid.
