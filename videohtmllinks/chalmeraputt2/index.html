1
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
Who is the spoilt brat here?

2
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,250
Can't you dry your own knickers?

3
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,160
Who threw it in my bucket? Who did it?

4
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
I did.

5
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,700
Fine, I'll have it dried.

6
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,750
Iron it as well.

7
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,040
He anyway doesn't do anything.

8
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,620
Uncle, stop playing with the drums.
How about feeding us?

9
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,750
I can only cook if
you get me groceries.

10
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,080
There is nothing left in the kitchen.

11
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,790
There is nothing left
in the pocket as well, uncle.

12
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,290
You never had anything.

13
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,790
And you won't part with
it even if you have it.

14
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,370
Do you have any?

15
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,870
Right, like you don't know.

16
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't hang my clothes
on the hook because of you.

17
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,540
I had folded and kept
it under the pillow.

18
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,080
You stole two pounds
which were in it to buy glue.

19
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,200
Like you are going to run in a marathon.

20
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,870
- We would have bought carrots instead.
- Yes.

21
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,580
You are starving but
you won't give up on style.

22
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,160
He's wasting money on his shoes.

23
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,830
We could have brought rice instead!

24
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,330
I am dying with hunger here.

25
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,450
- Hello?
- Yeah! Good morning.

26
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,500
- Is this pizza store?
- Yes, sir.

27
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,200
- Just a moment, please.
- Okay.

28
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,500
What will you have, from pizza store?

29
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,870
Four pizzas, one garlic bread..

30
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,750
Slow down, bro.

31
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,750
One garlic bread.

32
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,200
Okay, one garlic bread, please.

33
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,120
- Okay.
- Chicken wings.

34
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,540
- One garlic bread.
- One supremo, one.

35
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,370
Dessert?

36
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,540
Yes, do it.

37
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,580
Two brownies with
vanilla ice cream, okay?

38
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,540
- Ask for extra sauce.
- Surely, sir.

39
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,700
Please add sauce. How much is total?

40
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,040
- 20 pounds.
- Okay.

41
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,410
Can you make it fast?
I can pay you extra, okay?

42
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,160
And the address is.. 76 Clarence Road.

43
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,790
Thanks, cheers mate. Okay.

44
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,000
- Hi!
- Good morning, sir.

45
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,910
- Morning.
- Very fast service.

46
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,870
Thank you, sir.

47
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,540
- Where is bread crumbs?
- Here's your order.

48
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,200
Okay. Okay, thank you.

49
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,620
And bread crumbs?

50
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,950
- Here.
- Okay.

51
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,250
Can you give me the bill, please?

52
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,250
I'll come back in two minutes.

53
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,410
- Here you go.
- You've got nice hair.

54
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,950
Okay. I am waiting here.

55
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,120
- Stay there.
- Thank you.

56
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,080
- Get them out quickly.
- Hello! Please give me my money!

57
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,080
Give it!

58
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,750
Please, give my money.
I am getting late.

59
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,160
Hello!

60
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,250
- Anybody there?
- Sauce? Where's the sauce?

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,790
- In the bag.
- Hello!

62
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,870
Hey, man! I am getting late.
I got to go.

63
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,000
It's not here.

64
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,290
- Hello!
- Uncle, I think I forgot.

65
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,700
- Please, give my money. - Please, get it.
I don't enjoy it without the sauce.

66
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,540
- I have to go for another delivery.
- I'll be right back, uncle. Don't worry.

67
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,830
Come on uncle, because of the sauce?

68
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,410
Hey man, why are you shouting?

69
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,750
I delivered my food.
I am waiting for the money.

70
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,750
- Here?
- Yeah.

71
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,040
Nobody lives here, man.

72
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,330
I've just delivered food.

73
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,290
Look, my kids are sleeping.

74
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,910
- I'll call police otherwise.
- Okay, sorry. Sorry.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,250
- Do you have any extra sauce?
- Yeah, I have.

76
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,290
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

77
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,370
Thank you.

78
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,750
Yes?

79
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,330
What time?

80
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,370
Okay, brother.

81
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,750
Okay cheers, buddy. Bye, bye.

82
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,410
Whose call it was?

83
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,500
There is a musical show.

84
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,830
- He sent us an invitation.
- Who is coming?

85
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,910
Lakhaari keeps getting
such invitations.

86
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,910
Take us along.

87
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,160
Take us along,
we too will get to enjoy it.

88
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,870
There are a few places
I like to go alone as well.

89
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,950
I cannot take you with me everywhere.

90
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,950
Take us along,
we'll manage to pay for the expenses.

91
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,950
Fine, I'll think of something.

92
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,290
- Shall we?
- Let's go.

93
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,450
- Where is Mr. Khan coming from?
- Lahore, Pakistan.

94
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,410
Jinder, first you make a promise..

95
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,540
..that you will handover our full
wages and won't take a commission.

96
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,290
I don't want to kill you by lying.

97
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,450
You should be grateful that
we are getting food to eat. Let's go.

98
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:53,790
Come.

99
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,250
"The who befriended a bird.."

100
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,750
Today is with me here
harmonium master Tabrez Wasim..

101
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,500
..and along with him here is Mr. Khan.

102
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:20,160
"And I fed her my flesh.."

103
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,040
Did you speak to Chaudhary?

104
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,750
You can talk to him later.

105
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,750
How much time do we
have left for the train?

106
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,200
Only ten minutes.

107
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,580
"She fled away.."

108
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:45,580
"And never came back."

109
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,500
"Whenever my broken heart.."

110
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,700
"Whenever.."

111
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,750
Let's go, hurry up.

112
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,700
I don't understand.

113
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,580
Chaudhary's phone is switched off.

114
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,700
Father must have gone to sleep by now.

115
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,540
Now where will we spend the night?

116
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,910
This is a very cold country.

117
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,290
Why did you leave your shawl
on the tabla? What is shivering?

118
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,950
You covered your harmonium
so I too covered my tabla.

119
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,000
I thought maybe there is..

120
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,120
..a custom of leaving something
behind for the maestro.

121
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,870
Thank God for giving us
arms so that we can do this.

122
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,750
If only God has blessed us
with hair as well.

123
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,870
Let's hope we get a place
to spend the night.

124
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,750
I am wondering where should we sleep.

125
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,660
Binder, you had called?

126
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,950
I am working, I didn't realise.

127
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,580
But I can't hear you working.

128
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,620
I am kneading flour.
Should I also scream while doing so?

129
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,910
Well..

130
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,500
I wanted to talk to you.

131
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,410
Come to the point,
I am getting late for work.

132
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,830
Rupi's future in-laws want
the marriage to take place soon.

133
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,450
Okay.

134
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,700
- When?
- They are eager.

135
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,540
They say we can even
do it next week if we want.

136
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,660
Fine, we have to get
her married someday anyway.

137
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,040
Today or tomorrow doesn't
make a difference.

138
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,120
- Talk to them.
- Okay.

139
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,040
I'll talk to the matchmaker.

140
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,580
It's your father. Here.

141
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,620
- Talk.
- Video call..

142
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,250
Hello, dear. How are you?

143
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:38,250
- Hello, daddy.
- Hello.

144
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,160
Daddy, you shouldn't knead
flour in front of me. I don't like it.

145
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,250
I am doing it for you.

146
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,370
- Move it a little.
- Hello, dear?

147
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,370
How are you, Rupi?

148
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,200
- Hello, brother.
- Hello.

149
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,000
Let me know if you need anything.
I'll send it over.

150
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Let him know, dear.
He is anyway not going to send it.

151
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,450
Come on, uncle!

152
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,370
- Hello, aunt.
- Hello, son.

153
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,080
- God bless you.
- Thank you, thank you.

154
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,370
Take good care of my sister.

155
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,410
Of course I will, son.

156
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
You should take care of your uncle.

157
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,040
Don't worry about uncle, aunt.

158
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,700
We have girls surrounding us idlers
but no one spares a glance at him.

159
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,750
- Come on! - We are keeping him in line,
let me tell you.

160
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,540
Bye, I'll talk to you later.

161
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,410
- Bye.
- Bye.

162
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,450
Okay.

163
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,290
This place is getting rented..

164
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,250
There go our chances of free meals.

165
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,290
The tenant is hot but.

166
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,910
Shall I try?

167
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,450
She is looking at you.

168
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,870
Let's take other things out later.

169
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,620
Hey girls, how are you?

170
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,450
We are living there.

171
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,410
- Neighbours..
- Hello. Don't you have any shame?

172
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,080
You already started flirting?

173
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,160
Hello, how are you! Take the bags!

174
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,580
- This is..
- Not that one, this one.

175
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,410
Go and tell them that
I'll be a little late.

176
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,620
Okay?

177
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,910
Let's go.

178
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,830
No it's okay, we'll carry them.

179
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,160
I've only left Punjab
and not Punjabi culture.

180
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,750
My uncle says that..

181
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,750
..you should take whatever
help you can in a foreign country.

182
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,160
Let's go.

183
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,250
What happened?

184
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,000
I'll feed his lunch
to the birds today.

185
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,790
Let's follow him before he
flees away with our bags. Come on.

186
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
Let's go.

187
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,620
You want them in the closet?

188
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,870
No.

189
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,370
Kitchen is at the back,
washroom is right next to it.

190
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,950
Bedroom is upstairs, I think.

191
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,410
You are quite lucky
to get neighbours like us.

192
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,200
We have a very sporting nature.

193
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,660
You should feel proud
of being a lyrist's neighbours.

194
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,500
I am a lyrist.

195
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,410
- You are a lyrist?
- Yes.

196
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,950
I too love poetries.

197
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,330
Oh really? Then shall I make some tea?

198
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,330
Your poetry along with my tea,
it will be great fun.

199
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,580
Hey mister,
you won't get anything from here.

200
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
We too are daily wagers. Thank you.

201
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,040
How many times will you thank me?

202
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,290
I'll keep coming to help you.

203
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,450
Bye, I'll get going now.
Myself Jinder.

204
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,120
- Myself Bal.
- Hi.

205
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,910
Let me know if you need anything.

206
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,950
Cheers, bye.

207
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,910
Jinder?

208
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,040
- Yes?
- Just checking.

209
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,540
Also get the taps checked then.

210
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,950
There is no hot water in the kitchen.

211
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,950
Okay..

212
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,500
How does he know so
much about this place?

213
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,500
He must be bluffing.

214
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,500
Neither Chaudhary nor your
father is answering the phones.

215
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,660
Nor does God answering my prayers.

216
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,500
Then they say that Buta curses.

217
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,160
I think we should go back
to Mr. Khan and apologise.

218
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,250
You know I had trouble
sleeping last night.

219
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,870
I faced no trouble.

220
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,200
I slept on the street. It was
quite breezy. I faced no trouble.

221
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:56,200
I felt someone licking
my face at night.

222
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:57,540
When I woke up,
I saw that it was a dog.

223
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,580
I tried to scare him away,
and his owner took him away.

224
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,120
I faced no trouble.

225
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,000
The building we were
sleeping in front off..

226
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,750
We cursed by a local.

227
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,200
I faced no trouble.

228
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,330
I went back to sleep on the street.

229
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,250
No, I too don't have any
problem sleep on the street.

230
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,450
It's not like someone
recognises me over here.

231
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,290
The only thing troubling me
is that there are cameras everywhere..

232
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,040
..if police learns about
this then we will sleep here..

233
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,120
..and wake up in our homes in Punjab.

234
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,370
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Yes.

235
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,200
- He answered?
- God answered my prayers!

236
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,040
- He answered?
- No.

237
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,200
I think this country is very poor.

238
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,750
This is not a poor country, son.

239
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,410
If it was poor then they wouldn't
have gold statues everywhere.

240
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,910
Here we have gold statues
without any guards..

241
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,790
..whereas they even chain
steel glasses in Punjab.

242
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,370
Come on, let's check it out.

243
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,160
It's made out of gold.
I thought it was some dog..

244
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,660
Let's take a selfie with it.

245
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,250
Okay, let's take a selfie.

246
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,830
It is very lanky.

247
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,700
I think it is diabetic.

248
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,040
No, I think this is the result
of starving in this country.

249
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,160
No, I think the one who made him,
slapped him later.

250
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,250
I think the maker didn't
have a lot of material to work with.

251
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,870
Look at his moustaches.
They look like a dog holding sticks.

252
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,660
Do you want a selfie with
me or get me a marriage proposal?

253
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,950
He's one of our own!

254
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,620
- Really?
- He has coloured himself golden?

255
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,870
I think he's happen
to see his own countrymen.

256
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,410
- He is happy. He is happy.
- Yes.

257
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,620
- You are happy to meet us?
- Lift your foot!

258
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,160
Get lost!

259
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,500
Get to your work! Don't disturb me.

260
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,000
- We are disturbing you?
- Go!

261
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,080
People who aren't even lent cycles
back home manage to bag a UK visa?

262
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,080
Bloody idiots!

263
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,580
No hot water for real.

264
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,790
Shall I call him?

265
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,200
Don't make me hurt you.

266
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:08,370
"Oh farmer from Punjab,
why did you work for daily wages?"

267
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,250
Get them!

268
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,910
Coming, brother!

269
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,120
Move faster. Hurry up now.

270
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,910
I am coming!

271
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,620
Jinder, for how long will
we keep working in shifts like this?

272
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,870
We won't die for another10-15
if we keep getting food.

273
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,370
Father's calling.

274
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,750
Tell him how much
shifts you have been on.

275
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,000
I seek your blessings.

276
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,620
And here I am begging those
from whom I have taken a loan.

277
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,370
You are right,
but tell me what do you want me to do?

278
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,500
I am still at work.

279
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,290
Let's do a video call.

280
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,250
Then I will know whether
you are at work or in bed.

281
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,540
You don't trust me?

282
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,410
You want me to curse you?

283
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,450
Don't you know me?

284
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,500
- Do a video call.
- Fine, answer it.

285
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,620
- Tell me. - Tell me how many shifts
you did last week.

286
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,950
Four shifts, daddy.

287
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,500
But you send me money only for three.

288
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,040
You don't want me to eat?
You want me to die?

289
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,700
Didn't we do five shifts, Billa?

290
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,870
He isn't asking how many you did.
I did four, daddy.

291
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,290
Then how did he do five shifts?

292
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,250
Forget it, daddy. He is my friend.

293
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,620
He will help me become a citizen.

294
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,080
Let me talk to him.

295
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,450
Jinder.

296
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,700
Hello, uncle.

297
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,200
Are you a citizen here, son?

298
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,660
Yes, British passport.

299
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,950
Okay, let me talk to Billa.

300
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,830
- Yes?
- He looks like a cheat.

301
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,120
Beware of him.

302
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,120
I sent you abroad by
borrowing 15 lakhs rupees.

303
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,950
You have only returned
300,000 in the past two years.

304
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,830
I am sending all that I can, daddy.
Now do you expect me to rob a bank?

305
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,040
Did Nathu's son rob
a bank to build a bungalow?

306
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,790
He went abroad with you.

307
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,080
I am selling frozen water here.

308
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,200
And you?

309
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,000
You cannot find work in UK?

310
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,040
Gaffer is coming this way, daddy.

311
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,250
We'll first destroy Nathu's
bungalow after you become a citizen.

312
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,410
Yes, we will.

313
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,260
You know what, dear?

314
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,930
We will sit here..

315
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,590
..and settle everything today.

316
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,640
What a view!

317
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,470
It's your son.

318
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,800
I hope everything is fine.

319
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,590
I hope UK didn't ban him
after looking at his face.

320
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,390
- Hello.
- Greetings, father.

321
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,840
I have been calling you all night.
Your phone was switched off.

322
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,180
Ask him whether he has
reached there safe and sound?

323
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,840
I will. Did you meet any girl
who is a UK citizen in the plane?

324
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,470
They don't serve such
girls for breakfast here.

325
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,050
I have managed to come to UK,
haven't I? I'll find one here.

326
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,340
He'll find one there! Our relatives
refused to marry their daughters to you.

327
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,510
And he think he'll find one in UK.

328
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,590
Son, I told you, I have a friend there.

329
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,430
Kamran from Gujjarawala.

330
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,220
He lives in Birmingham.

331
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,510
I have already called him up.
Just go and meet him.

332
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,180
He'll find you a girl
and get you the citizenship.

333
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,970
You had asked me to
meet someone before as well.

334
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,970
- He won't meet us.
- Where are you right now?

335
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,720
Wandering around in the streets.

336
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,300
I think we will see
the entire UK like this.

337
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,800
Chaudhary has switched off his phone.

338
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,510
- I'll send his other number.
- Okay, father.

339
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:02,220
- What did he say?
- He said he'll send another number.

340
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,010
Here it is.

341
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,050
Hello?

342
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,470
- Greetings, Mr. Chaudhary.
- Greetings. May God be with you.

343
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,050
I am Wasim's son.

344
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,760
Oh yes, your father had called me.

345
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,050
Did you face any problem?

346
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,430
We spent the nights on streets.

347
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,930
Your phone was switched off.

348
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,260
I keep my work phone
switched off at night.

349
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,220
We called you in the morning as well.

350
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,090
I was busy in the morning.

351
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,510
Where are you right now?

352
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,800
- Mr. Chaudhary?
- I am in my office.

353
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,590
I think I am close to your office.

354
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,220
Hello? Hello? What happened?

355
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,180
- Mr. Chaudhary?
- What happened?

356
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,680
He isn't dead. He's just gone silent.

357
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,430
Thank you.

358
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,760
Yes? Yes, Mr. Chaudhary?

359
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,800
A client had come over.

360
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,680
I'll send you over my address.

361
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,640
Let's meet in the evening.
- Please hurry up.

362
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,220
Bye, brother. See you tomorrow.

363
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,090
Not tomorrow.
We have enough men for tomorrow.

364
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,010
I'll call you if
I'll be needing you two.

365
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,800
Please take us along. You
can pay 10 pounds less if you want.

366
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:32,800
I'll at least have a shift to work on.

367
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,930
I cannot redo my house
just to give you a job.

368
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,090
Take us along, at least one of us.

369
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,390
Take him along.

370
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,340
Billa, run!

371
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,760
Hold on..

372
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,050
It's an ambulance.

373
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,390
You made me lose.

374
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,260
Here are two pounds.
- You won.

375
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,510
I had made a bet with him that I'll
reach the signal before the ambulance.

376
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,050
He won.

377
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,800
Don't worry, you can race
with the ice cream van next.

378
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,840
Don't worry, you can race
with the ice cream van next.

379
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,840
Wonderful.
This is such a beautiful house.

380
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,800
Thank God we finally found it.

381
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,140
Chaudhary has a very big house.

382
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,340
Look at his name! Chaudhary Shamsher!

383
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,140
His chest must be as wide as the door.

384
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,090
I am sure he must be sitting
far beyond his 1500 rooms..

385
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,140
..on an elephant or a horse.

386
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,180
You cannot have an elephant
or a horse in a bungalow!

387
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,390
I think Chaudhary must be
lying like this in the swimming pool.

388
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,890
A dozen white girls must
be standing outside with a towel.

389
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,430
So that they can help
him get dry after he comes out.

390
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,140
Why isn't Chaudhary coming out?

391
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,930
Are you crazy?
Chaudhary won't come on his own.

392
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,430
He must be having
a servant to do this job.

393
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,550
They are the same people.

394
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,260
Have they come here to curse me?

395
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,970
What is it? What is it?

396
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,510
What's happening with you?

397
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,090
Your nose is as sharp as a nail!

398
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,140
You should be grateful that
it didn't pierce through your hand.

399
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,890
Brother, did you get this nose later?

400
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,300
Go call Chaudhary.

401
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,300
- What do you want?
- Behave yourself.

402
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,390
You shouldn't do that.

403
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,590
Go and call Chaudhary.

404
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,930
Such people keep twirling
like this and then say that..

405
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,180
..they saw everywhere
but couldn't find Chaudhary.

406
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,180
Go and call Chaudhary.

407
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,930
I am Chaudhary.

408
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,890
You had said he'll have
chest as wide as the door.

409
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,180
This Chaudhary can
slip through closed doors.

410
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,970
Go and call Chaudhary Shamsher.

411
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,010
And who do you think I am?
I am Chaudhary.

412
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,760
Are you going to call him
or should I complain to him..

413
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,890
..that his servant
claims to be Chaudhary.

414
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,180
- Go and complain.
- Chaudhary Shamsher!

415
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,340
Yes?

416
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,970
I am Chaudhary Shamsher! From UK!

417
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,220
He is Chaudhary!

418
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,930
Hey tong..

419
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:29,090
- Go, call Chaudhary.
- Hey rusted nail..

420
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,180
- Go, call Chaudhary.
- Have you seen your face?

421
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,010
You look like a roadkill.

422
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,550
- Go and call Chaudhary.
- You look like a hairpin.

423
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,550
Go and call Chaudhary.

424
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,930
Do you recognise me or should I leave?

425
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,640
Chaudhary Shamsher!

426
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,680
- Chaudhary Shamsher!
- Yes.

427
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,300
I knew that you are Chaudhary
the moment you came out.

428
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,550
Who else could have
such a glowing face?

429
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,390
Your face suggest that
you make all the decision in UK.

430
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:55,340
Mr. Chaudhary,
you have such a tiny nose.

431
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,090
You should have had a big one.

432
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,180
Now come to the point.

433
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,550
I am Sheikh Wasim's son from Lahore.

434
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,720
You are Sheikh Wasim's son?

435
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,430
- Yes, Mr. Chaudhary.
- You are Sheikh Wasim's son?

436
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:10,590
Yes, Mr. Chaudhary.
Mr. Chaudhary, I am not that.

437
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,680
I am not like that.

438
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,340
- My name is Buta (plant).
- A plant without a single leave?

439
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,220
He is a cactus, Mr. Chaudhary.

440
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,680
He has no leaves.

441
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,300
I brought him along with him.

442
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,050
He is my friend.

443
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,550
- He is?
- Yes.

444
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,470
But he looks like a thief.

445
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,550
- Tavrej, I am a thief?
- Yes.

446
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,050
You look like what he says.

447
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,430
No, no, no. It is not so.

448
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,800
Your father told me such.

449
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,260
Oh I see, your father calls me a thief
there and you call me a thief here!

450
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,840
And then they say that Buta curses!

451
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,390
Don't curse!

452
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:45,800
His father called me and
said that he and his friend..

453
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,590
..are coming over to stay with me.

454
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,590
Oh I see.

455
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,220
- Mr. Chaudhary, will we be
sleeping here? - No.

456
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,430
- Is a lady changing her
clothes inside? - No.

457
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,550
- Then the dog is unleashed?
- No way.

458
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,890
Then why don't you
ask us to come inside?

459
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,510
Actually,
I am so happy to see you two..

460
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,970
- Oh I see.
- ..that I am lost my mind.

461
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,090
Let's go.

462
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,720
- This way.
- Mr. Chaudhary, the door is over here.

463
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,970
Oh yes. Come on in.
Really sorry about that.

464
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,930
Come in, no problem. Come inside.

465
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,970
Oh damn!

466
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,090
Not coming inside?

467
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,090
We will,
after we get ourselves bandaged.

468
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,890
Oh, I am sorry. - Are you hurt?

469
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,300
- No, let's go.
- Sorry! Let's go.

470
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,390
- After you.
- No, after you.

471
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,720
You are right.

472
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,550
Mr. Chaudhary,
this doesn't seem right.

473
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,590
- You go ahead.
- I don't like his face.

474
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,300
- You two..
- Let's go.

475
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,140
Come this way.

476
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,050
Mr. Chaudhary, this is so messy.
Who stays here, a dog?

477
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,140
Don't be crazy. I think Mr.
Chaudhary's servant stays here.

478
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,340
He caused this mess.

479
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,680
Where are the other rooms, Mr.
Chaudhary?

480
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,260
This is all it is.

481
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,640
You stay with a dog?

482
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,180
I will have to, henceforth.

483
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,470
You should give me
a different room then.

484
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,340
Hey Mr. Different Room,
this is the only room!

485
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,180
Here's where you will sleep,
sit and eat.

486
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,840
And the staircase outside?
Do they lead to Paris?

487
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,140
It is owned by the landlord.

488
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,510
Don't look at or touch anything.

489
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:11,220
You will eat,
sleep, sit and stay here.

490
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,680
And what if one wants to walk?

491
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,220
You can walk till the kitchen.

492
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,390
How is he a Chaudhary?

493
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,090
He has no white girls working for him.
He has no pool.

494
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,640
And then they say that Buta curses.

495
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,260
Listen to me, if you want
to curse then curse in this room.

496
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,720
The sound shouldn't go outside.

497
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,800
This is a private property.

498
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,970
You will have to stay cautious.

499
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:36,140
Listen to me, we'll have to share
the electricity, water and gas bills.

500
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,970
A third each.

501
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:40,930
How much will it be per person, Mr.
Chaudhary?

502
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:44,050
Around 350 pounds per head.

503
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,010
It's okay, my father will pay that.

504
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:51,260
Mr. Chaudhary,
I think we should get another person.

505
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,890
That will bring down the rent.

506
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,840
Oh noble man,
I want two more to join us.

507
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:01,430
So that the rent decreases
and I can stay for free.

508
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:06,720
Mr. Chaudhary, don't rent it to so
many people, it will be too crowded.

509
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,010
Very good.

510
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,720
Eight people have stayed in
this room before and no one objected.

511
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,260
- Who are you to object?
- Then invite everyone from Lahore.

512
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,720
It is a very big room!

513
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,180
Mr. Chaudhary,
how will we two sleep on this bed?

514
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,140
No, no, no!

515
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,800
I'll sleep on this bed.

516
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:24,890
I cannot sleep on floor.

517
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,720
So we will be sleeping on the floor?

518
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:31,050
Mr. Chaudhary,
you know that we are artists.

519
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,010
Oh, sorry. I forgot.

520
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,430
You are artists.

521
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,800
- Yes.
- Come here.

522
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,510
Let's throw the mattress down there.

523
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,340
We won't shift for another year, I swear.

524
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,470
Let's sleep now. We have
an early morning shift tomorrow.

525
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,680
Come on.

526
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,800
Time for some practice, boys!

527
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,930
Jinder, I don't care how
well or how badly you write..

528
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,260
..but I cannot sleep till
I don't listen to your song.

529
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,090
No uncle, I am too tired today.

530
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,510
I swear, we are dead.

531
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,260
It doesn't take too much to sing.

532
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,590
- Start singing.
- I am not in the mood either.

533
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,680
We don't have work in the morning.
Gaffer said not to come tomorrow.

534
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,180
I have an offer.

535
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,050
Both of you come with me.

536
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,680
I have a booking.

537
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,720
You always convince me with that.

538
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,720
Come on.

539
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,430
I think we might have
to move in the morning itself.

540
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,010
"Well done, young man."

541
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,430
"I am so proud of you."

542
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:31,930
"Oh farmer from Punjab,
why did you work for daily wages?"

543
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,260
"May God have mercy on you!"

544
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,640
"God bless you, the one from UK!"

545
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,970
"May God have mercy on you!"

546
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,140
"God bless you, the one from UK!"

547
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:47,720
"Your Taxi can be found on the streets,
you may always get good fares."

548
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,430
"Now they ride trucks and trailers
who used to ride Mahindras and Fords."

549
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:54,010
"And Fords!"

550
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,140
Uncle, this is for our future.

551
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:02,050
"Now white men are jealous of you,
you are now a top class businessman."

552
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,430
"May God have mercy on you!"

553
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,760
"God bless you, the one from UK!"

554
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,260
"May God have mercy on you!"

555
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,390
"God bless you,
the one who got sponsored!"

556
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,340
Well done.

557
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:17,340
No matter how he is,
but he writes better than you do.

558
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,590
You bore me with your poetry.

559
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Oh I see.

560
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,260
Shall I make him my master?

561
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,640
Don't make me hurt you.

562
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,050
Come on, go to sleep.

563
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,260
Switch off the lights.

564
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,010
Hello, maestro!

565
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,590
Go on. You are 10 minutes late.

566
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,050
This is UK. You'll get scolded at work.

567
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,970
Are you spying only
on us or the whole locality?

568
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:49,180
"He stayed out for 12 years,
he came back with sweets."

569
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,260
"Come on, let's meet!"

570
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:55,220
"Come on, let's meet!"

571
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,930
- Take this. - "Come on, let's meet!"
- Two, three, four.

572
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:04,180
- Take that.
- "Come on, let's meet!"

573
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,840
Seven, eight, nine.

574
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,890
25 notes.

575
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,090
Stop counting. Sing.

576
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,840
"Say it!"

577
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,930
"Say it slowly.."

578
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,550
"Say it!"

579
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,720
"Say it slowly.."

580
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,220
"Say it!"

581
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,470
"Say it slowly.."

582
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,550
Uncle!

583
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,300
We are in trouble today.
Now teach us how we should run!

584
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,800
Don't follow me! Run! Run! Run!
Do you want me to get into trouble?

585
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:47,390
- Take me along.
- Run alone! Go!

586
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,340
Uncle, I..

587
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,590
Run, Jinder!

588
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,220
Hey dude!

589
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,680
Hello!

590
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,260
Where to, Punjab's farmer?

591
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,970
Don't bug me,
I am already late for the show.

592
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,140
Sing me a song.

593
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,930
We'll give you a ride if we like it.

594
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,430
You are taking Jinder Batalvi lightly.

595
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,720
I will soon have my shows in Camberley.

596
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,340
You will need to buy
tickets to watch my shows.

597
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:32,840
Oh I am so sorry, superstar.
Come on, get in.

598
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:35,050
Bless the car with your presence.

599
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,140
Get in.

600
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,010
How much more time will it take?

601
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,760
You are bound to take longer
just because I took a lift from you.

602
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:50,640
What's the hurry?

603
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,890
You already lost your day's job.

604
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,140
The wedding must be over by now.

605
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,430
Poor me needs to
find another job, right?

606
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,180
Oh, do you know anything else as well?

607
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,550
I thought you only
know how to sing and dance.

608
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,140
I can sing and dance. I can
work on construction sites as well.

609
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,590
- I know electrical work.
- Oh I see.

610
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,760
- I can somewhat handle
plumbing as well. - Great.

611
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,300
Do you get anything?

612
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,720
I know a lot of things,
but what are you two doing?

613
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,180
You shouldn't be working at this age.

614
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,720
You are in UK, you should have fun.

615
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,720
Spend your father's
money and live a good life.

616
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,140
I don't have a father..

617
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,590
..so no good life for me.

618
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:39,050
"We girls no longer live
in the dream world, mother!"

619
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:46,140
"Worries have taken
over our smiles, mother!"

620
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:52,590
"We girls no longer live
in the dream world, mother!"

621
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,590
"In the dream world.."

622
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:02,930
"Beautiful girls
take a step outside.."

623
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:10,260
"They leave to be at
the par with the boys."

624
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:17,340
"Matching them at every step, mother!"

625
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:21,680
"We girls no longer
live in the dream world.."

626
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,510
I kept calling you yesterday.
Why didn't you answer the call?

627
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,720
Is everything alright?

628
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,430
Don't ask, Binder. We barely escaped.
We ran to save our lives.

629
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,720
It would have been
good if we got caught.

630
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,180
I would at least be
able to come back to you.

631
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,640
How are Jinder and Billa?

632
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,970
Jinder and Billa are okay and safe.
We are fine.

633
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,140
But I lost my drum.

634
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,970
Don't worry about the drum.

635
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,140
You can buy a new one.

636
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,180
You have the tuner
and the adjuster, right?

637
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,890
What will I tune and adjust with them?

638
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,220
What are you saying?

639
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,390
I'll talk to you later.

640
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,050
Don't worry, uncle.

641
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,890
We have put on name
and address on the drum.

642
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,890
Who knows some decent
person might come across it..

643
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:59,970
..and they might return it to us.

644
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,760
God answered your prayer pretty soon.

645
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,260
Decent people got hold of it.

646
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,390
Oh damn!

647
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,550
Take your emergency bags.

648
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,140
Let's go, Jinder!

649
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,800
Go, go, go!

650
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:03,760
Yes, daddy?

651
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,800
Tell me about your shifts this week.

652
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,470
Shifts?

653
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,550
Monday I went to construction site.

654
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,680
On Tuesday I went to the housing site.

655
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,550
- On Wednesday I..
- Start driving.

656
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,470
He did three shifts last week.

657
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,050
And four shifts this week.

658
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,760
And the Gaffer didn't pay for 23 shifts.

659
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:25,550
And we will be in big trouble
if we don't hang up now. Drive!

660
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,390
- Yes?
- We are looking Bikkar Dholi.

661
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,590
- Sorry?
- Bikkar Dholi.

662
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,050
It's Bikkar Dholi.

663
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:45,930
No, we are standing on the street.
Police has raided our house.

664
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,550
Listen, do you have
a place where we can stay?

665
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,140
Let me know if you know any place.

666
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,090
A place to stay? No, bro.

667
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,010
I'll still to find out.

668
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,800
I'm a little busy.

669
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:55,840
Can I talk to you later?

670
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:03,180
Okay, bro.

671
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,890
All of them are useless.

672
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,260
Your friends are just like you.

673
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,510
I am telling you,
there is nothing to worry about.

674
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,760
I'll do something about this.

675
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:17,890
I don't feel like trusting you,
but unfortunately I'll have to.

676
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,050
Uncle, I have 20 places
I can go to alone.

677
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,590
I am not going because..

678
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,220
..I know you'll keep wandering
in the streets if I leave.

679
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,730
Why aren't you two sleeping?

680
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,690
Can't sleep, Mr. Chaudhary.

681
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,940
Why?

682
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,600
Family needs money.

683
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,730
Mr. Chaudhary, how much time
will it take for us to get a job?

684
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:45,150
Even citizens don't
get jobs easily here.

685
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,900
You are still strugglers.

686
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,020
Mr. Chaudhary,
how did you become a citizen?

687
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,730
Oh, like this.

688
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,560
I never told this to anyone.

689
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,690
Fine then don't tell us as well.

690
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,980
- What did you do?
- First I stretched my legs.

691
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,560
It was a bloody long journey.

692
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,440
Did you come in a plane or a crow.

693
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,810
Listen to me..

694
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,900
If you want to make money,
you'll need to work three shifts.

695
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,650
I used to work three shifts.

696
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,440
But I was unique.

697
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,730
Because I quite young.

698
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,480
Switch off the lights.

699
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,560
Uncle?

700
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,690
Uncle?

701
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,440
Please spend the night
in the car tonight.

702
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,810
I'll find us a home by tomorrow.

703
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,310
I have no other option.

704
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,690
My back's hurting.

705
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,730
My back's hurting.

706
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:49,940
Hello?

707
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,350
Yes, who is it?

708
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,400
You didn't recognise me?

709
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,310
Oh, you.

710
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,900
No girl has ever called
me from a UK number.

711
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,900
That too at this hour. That's why.

712
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,770
Where are you? You are still not home.

713
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:10,060
I forgot to tell you.
We left that house.

714
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,350
- Why?
- It is very congested.

715
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,520
Three of us using one washroom.

716
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,980
We are looking for something big.

717
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,270
The cops gave the drum to me.

718
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,310
You can come and take it
whenever you want.

719
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,440
Oh, I see.

720
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,850
Anyway, take care, wherever you are.

721
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,650
Fine, okay.

722
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,440
Bye.

723
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,400
Who was it?

724
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,020
The Queen, from the Buckingham palace.

725
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,440
She said she'll arrange
for a room there, don't stress.

726
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:39,900
I'll be right back.

727
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,480
Be careful.

728
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,520
There is good news for you, uncle.

729
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:48,810
You found us a home?

730
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,310
I found your drum.

731
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:56,150
Excuse me!

732
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:00,520
- Jinder..
- "It is time to meet.."

733
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,400
Excuse me!

734
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,560
Did you realise this
is private property?

735
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,310
What's your name?

736
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,480
Where are you from?

737
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,270
Your thumb. Here.

738
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,730
Right. Come with me.

739
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:36,230
[speaking gibberish]

740
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,350
No, what is your name?

741
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:39,940
Name?

742
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,150
[speaking gibberish]

743
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,020
When were you born?

744
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:48,060
[speaking gibberish]

745
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,560
You're just saying
the same thing again.

746
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:52,020
You're not trying to answer my question.
You're just repeating yourself here.

747
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,850
Where are you from?
So obviously, you're in England.

748
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,980
You've come here, haven't you,
so where are you from?

749
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,520
You're in England.

750
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,900
[speaking gibberish]

751
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,810
No, no, we're in England now.

752
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,560
[speaking gibberish]

753
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,060
How did you get here?

754
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:10,150
- Sir, I'm gonna show it to
you on the map now. - Yeah!

755
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,850
Come with me.

756
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,440
- No, no, no.
- No, no.

757
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,810
- Come here.
- Come here.

758
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,730
So now, me..

759
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,020
From.. UK.

760
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,900
Where are you from?

761
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,060
[speaking gibberish]

762
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,100
No, no, no.
You're not from England, are you?

763
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:31,060
You're from somewhere else.
Where in the world are you from?

764
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,600
[speaking gibberish]

765
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,810
[speaking gibberish]

766
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,690
Okay.

767
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,310
- Do you want to take a seat again?
- [speaking gibberish]

768
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,480
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

769
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,980
- Just take a seat.
- You're not getting out of here.

770
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,650
Brother, I hope they
haven't deported him already.

771
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,350
Not if they didn't find
any proof on him.

772
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,600
Then it should be fine.

773
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,190
And you have a good lawyer, okay?

774
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,480
Your work is done.

775
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:08,150
- How are you?
- Thank you for spending so much?

776
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:11,270
- Who does this for anyone else?
- Shut up.

777
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,190
Please don't tell father about it.
That I got caught.

778
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,810
Sorry, your father had called.
You have many missed calls.

779
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:20,850
Call him up.

780
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,480
Yes, daddy? Hello.

781
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:27,980
Where are you?

782
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:29,480
At work.

783
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,230
Did the police release you?

784
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,690
Why did you tell him?

785
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:36,520
I told him.

786
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,650
So what?

787
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,400
I didn't bother you, did I?

788
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,770
Or did I ask you for the money?

789
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,480
My friends bailed me out.

790
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,310
I sent 1000 pounds to your friends.

791
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,850
Counsellor, how much did it cost us?

792
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,520
800 pounds.

793
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,190
You took 1000 from daddy.

794
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,650
You should be grateful
to God that you got out.

795
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:03,560
Come on, let's go house hunting.

796
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:04,940
We've been running from pillar
to post for you since last night.

797
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,770
- Find a small one for me.
- Let's go.

798
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:14,310
"He keeps your in his pocket."

799
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:20,350
"He assumes.."

800
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,480
Mr. Chaudhary, you know how
do you look like with that helmet on?

801
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,440
- How do I look?
- Like a basking frog.

802
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,850
Shame on the life you've spent
and on that you have left.

803
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,810
Mr. Chaudhary, don't you
this cycle is too big for you?

804
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,100
I am sure you stand and ride it.

805
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,940
Give it back to the
kid you took it from.

806
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,600
His mother will find
your house soon enough.

807
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,520
She will come here and curse you.

808
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,900
That too in English.

809
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,900
Excuse me!

810
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:57,560
I have purchased it from my salary.
I spend 200 pounds on it.

811
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,520
Have you ever seen 200 pounds?

812
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,850
Mr. Chaudhary, what is your salary?

813
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,770
It depends on weather.

814
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:08,310
More on a sunny day
and less on a rainy day.

815
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,440
Mr. Chaudhary, I guessed what
work you do from what you just said.

816
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,060
What? What?

817
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,560
Let it go, Mr. Chaudhary.

818
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:18,400
You'll be in a bad mood the whole day.

819
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,480
Who knows what he has in his mind.

820
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:25,810
You should use your hands
like you use your tongue.

821
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,900
We are new here.
We shouldn't be using our hands.

822
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,350
I mean to clean utensils.

823
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,480
You need to clean
utensils with these hands.

824
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,150
- He will.
- And you will dust the house.

825
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,310
He will.

826
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,400
Mr. Chaudhary,
who will take care of the meals?

827
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,020
You two, together.

828
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,100
I don't like lazy people around me.

829
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:48,310
Caution is necessary.

830
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,100
And he won't do anything?

831
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:52,060
He's go straight into the ICU.

832
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:53,850
And then they say that Buta curses.

833
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,440
You should have said it to his face.

834
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,440
Then you would know
how he would throw Buta out.

835
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,440
Find me a house, please. Please try.

836
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,480
I don't even mind a small one.
A room will also do.

837
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,730
What is it?

838
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,480
Uncle, don't sit before him.

839
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,440
You too look like a beggar
by sitting before him.

840
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,060
He is at least steady.
But you even stay steady on your word.

841
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:17,270
You have been saying that we'll
find a house since two days now.

842
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,650
You want a house?

843
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,560
- There.
- Hear that.

844
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:24,020
Do you have one for yourself?

845
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:27,190
People like you stay
in burrows and not homes.

846
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:30,810
Hey golden owl.. the likes
of you sleep upside on a wire.

847
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,230
Careful,
they often attack on the knees.

848
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:34,650
Be careful.

849
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,020
Do you want a house or not?

850
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,560
Oh the counsellor for idiots.
You look like a pigeon's beak.

851
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:43,520
Worms like you hide in the tap.
He will get us a house.

852
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,020
Stop your nonsense and hear him out.

853
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:49,400
You don't look smart
but you say smart things.

854
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,480
Hear that.

855
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,400
I have a house,
but you'll have to find it.

856
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:55,270
Note down the address.

857
00:44:56,770 --> 00:45:00,520
6 Kennington road, Birmingham, West One.

858
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:04,560
Listen to me.
Go there and say Mr. Chaudhary..

859
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:06,190
- What will you say?
- Chaudhary..

860
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,900
Not Chaudhary! That's why
people don't give you a place.

861
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,060
Say Mr. Chaudhary.
Show him some respect.

862
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:12,770
- Mr. Chaudhary..
- Yes.

863
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:15,350
He will let you stay on rent.
Okay. Go.

864
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,810
Go. Get lost!

865
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:25,230
Hey bumblebee, if this is a joke
then we will do some serious damage.

866
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,730
You'll be lying statue
from tomorrow then.

867
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,350
I'll turn you into a sticker and..

868
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,810
Where are you? Mr. Khan keeps calling.

869
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:47,650
Mr. Khan is calling?

870
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:51,150
Yes. He keeps asking
if you have come back to Pakistan.

871
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:53,980
He has the passport.
I cannot fly away.

872
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:58,150
We never know with you. Men who
leave their homes anyway grow wings.

873
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:01,020
Don't get married to
a white female there.

874
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:04,650
Stupid, which white
girl will agree to marry me?

875
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:07,230
I got married to you
with great difficulty.

876
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:10,060
Take care of the kids, okay?

877
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:13,230
Tell me about mother, is she fine?

878
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,270
She misses you a lot.

879
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,150
Take care of her.

880
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:22,600
Take her for regular check ups.

881
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:24,150
Yes, we had done it.

882
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:27,940
Doctor says we will have
to do the operation.

883
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:31,270
I'll send so money
over as soon as I can.

884
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,980
Okay. Goodbye.

885
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:36,690
Goodbye.

886
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,270
- Back off.
- Buzz off!

887
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:46,940
Isn't he the same beggar
who stands at that juncture?

888
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:48,980
Son, we steal from beggars too.

889
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,730
This isn't a juncture
which has no walls.

890
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,690
We have a room here, we'll
strip you off all your belongings.

891
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:55,440
- I'll..
- Listen to me.

892
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,190
Don't beg from us.
To beg from beggar is a sin.

893
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:01,310
- I am Chaudhary.. - If you want to
meet Chaudhary then meet him outside.

894
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,440
You cannot meet him here.
That's it.

895
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,150
And he is Chaudhary only in name.
He is our servant.

896
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:07,810
He is such an idiot, this Chaudhary!

897
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,600
Trust me, we make him
do all the household chores.

898
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:12,810
I sleep on the bed whereas
he sleeps on the floor.

899
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:14,980
Chaudhary cleans the whole house.

900
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,600
I beat him up and make him do it.

901
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:19,520
I cannot sleep till he
doesn't massage my calves.

902
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:21,400
He also washes my dirty laundry.

903
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,770
He cleans our dirty dishes too.

904
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,810
Oh!

905
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:29,020
- He left..
- Just..

906
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,650
Keep the cycle and the bag inside..

907
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,520
..because precaution is necessary.

908
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,480
He is Mr. Chaudhary.

909
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,060
Yes.
You say anything without thinking.

910
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,560
Then you say that Buta curses.

911
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:44,270
Now Chaudhary will curse.

912
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:53,190
See, I told you, I massage
Mr. Chaudhary's calves before I sleep.

913
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:55,350
I consider you as my father,
Mr. Chaudhary.

914
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,770
Mr. Chaudhary,
you are the boss, I am the servant.

915
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:59,230
You don't need to say that.

916
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,520
I have three guests coming over.

917
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,060
When they ring the doorbell..

918
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:04,980
- We will open the door.
- No, don't open the door.

919
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,310
They will jump the
wall and come inside?

920
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,520
Can they walk through walls?

921
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,400
They shouldn't know that three
people are already staying here.

922
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,770
Clean this room and place
this mattress back on the bed.

923
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,020
And disappear when they come here.

924
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:20,650
I want to do a one to
one conversation with them.

925
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:21,900
Mr. Chaudhary,
considering the size of the room..

926
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:25,600
..no matter how much ever I try to
hide myself you'll see some part of me.

927
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:28,600
You should listen to your elders.
Then you say that Buta curses.

928
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:31,230
- Pick up the mattress.
- Come on. Pick it up.

929
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:36,850
Stand still. Remove your earphones.

930
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,060
- Straighten your collar.
- Okay.

931
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:40,600
You should act decent
before the landlord.

932
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:43,150
You let it be, you look decent.

933
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:44,770
But you aren't, actually.

934
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,190
You shouldn't ring the bell
so many times, it might get stuck.

935
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,900
- We want to meet Mr. Chaudhary.
- Why?

936
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:55,690
We want to rent a room.

937
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:59,190
Oh! Come in, come in.
Come in.

938
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:01,600
This is the house.

939
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,850
And don't consider it as your own.

940
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:07,560
Follow me.

941
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:11,690
This is the room
where we live together.

942
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,100
Do you stay here alone,
or does someone else too live here?

943
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:18,520
No, I am usually alone.

944
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:21,350
- Where's the kitchen?
- First left.

945
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:23,440
And the cook is checking
out the kitcehen.

946
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,480
What?

947
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:28,270
Uncle, since you are out there also
check out the washroom for Jinder.

948
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:30,100
- Which one of them is Jinder?
- I am.

949
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,480
- You will stay in the washroom?
- Mostly.

950
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:35,690
Well, the kitchen is
better than the last one.

951
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:37,600
There are only four of us anyway.
It won't be used much.

952
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:40,190
Keep a distance, man. Then they
say that Buta curses. Stay back!

953
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:42,600
- Does anyone else too stay here?
- He said he is alone.

954
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:46,480
Yes, I have partners.

955
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,150
Partner?

956
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:51,480
Partners, come here. No problem.

957
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,150
You were behind the curtain?

958
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,440
We were sitting behind
the curtain and calculating.

959
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:08,060
We have so much money.

960
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:10,230
We got 50,000 pounds
deposited in the bank..

961
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:11,480
..but he forgot which bank it was.

962
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,020
You shouldn't worry.

963
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,480
You are worrying only
for a small amount of 50,000.

964
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,770
What is 50,000 pounds?

965
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:19,940
We have so much money..

966
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,940
- ..that we wonder what we should do
with it! - Please, sit down. Sit.

967
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,900
- Please, sit.
- Wait a minute.

968
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:25,480
I'm getting a call from Punjab.

969
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:28,980
Papa. How are you, papa?
Are you fine?

970
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:32,520
No papa, you don't..
You don't understand.

971
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,350
I cannot have dinner
with Imran Khan on Friday.

972
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,440
He won't listen to you.
Let me talk to him.

973
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,350
Uncle, he cannot go
out for dinner on Friday.

974
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,940
He will be getting thrashed here.

975
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,150
- Uncle is laughing as well.
- Don't joke.

976
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:49,060
Hello? Yes, papa.

977
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:52,900
I'll talk to you later.
I'm in a business meeting.

978
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:54,900
Hang up.

979
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:57,850
Fine, don't hang up.
You too can listen in.

980
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,190
It will only consume
a balance of 1500 pounds.

981
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:03,100
- It's okay.
- Listen, shouldn't we hire a boy?

982
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:09,190
Yes, let's find an ordinary person
and give him 15,000 pounds.

983
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,980
It will help a poor man.

984
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,400
We have a lot of money.

985
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,600
- What happened?
- Oh no.

986
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:15,900
What happened, brother?

987
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,020
I had 50 pounds,
I dropped it somewhere.

988
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:18,980
- You dropped it?
- Here?

989
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,020
- Yes.
- Now?

990
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,940
- In this room?
- Yes.

991
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,400
Wait brother, we'll find it.
We are here for you.

992
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,560
You are so careless.
How can you drop money?

993
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:28,100
It must be here somewhere. Calm down.

994
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:29,650
Get up, brother.

995
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:31,230
Stand up.

996
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,810
Oh God, please help us find it.

997
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,730
Stand up, uncle.
I doubt you.

998
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:38,270
They were sitting here.
It must be here. Check over here.

999
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:39,980
We will find it from here.

1000
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:43,190
Brother, you should give me
one pound if I find your five pounds.

1001
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:44,150
- Yes.
- Yes.

1002
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,980
- We'll find it right away.
- Brother..

1003
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:48,980
..you should take them outside.

1004
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,020
I'll tidy up this room.

1005
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,770
We will share the chore.

1006
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,900
We will find them.

1007
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,560
Look you are a brother.
There is nothing to worry about.

1008
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:01,400
You just need to pay the rent on time.

1009
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,270
I'll handle them, I need a pound.

1010
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:05,690
- Okay.
- Deal done?

1011
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:09,150
- Done.
- Then get your bags and start partying.

1012
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:22,310
Making deliveries in the mornings.

1013
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,940
Working in the coffee shop in the
afternoons. And packing in the evenings.

1014
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,520
You sleep on a mattress
filled with pounds?

1015
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:27,650
Are you crazy?

1016
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:29,730
I use the pounds
to wipe my hands clean.

1017
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:31,730
Right. Cheers, bye.

1018
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,020
Did you manage to find 50 pounds?

1019
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:40,100
50 pounds?

1020
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:43,310
If I had dropped even 2 pounds,
I would've even opened the floor to check.

1021
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,060
You are such a fool!

1022
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:50,400
He told me that we'd spilt it equally.

1023
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:53,230
You shouldn't make fun of the poor.

1024
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:54,560
Some of us have weak hearts.

1025
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:57,310
- And the way you pulled our legs?
- What did we do?

1026
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,060
We left everything over there.
Do you know how much loss we incurred?

1027
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:01,190
You were there?

1028
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:03,850
- You know that VIP table?
- Yes.

1029
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,560
- Where all the VIPs sit?
- Yes.

1030
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,100
We were serving them cold drinks.

1031
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:09,560
- You were wearing black suits?
- Yes.

1032
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:10,600
You are such clever people.

1033
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:13,190
You didn't speak up when
they were acting to be rich.

1034
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:15,850
I thought they have just come.
I shouldn't insult them.

1035
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,350
It's amazing that you recognised us.

1036
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,980
It is not difficult to recognise you.

1037
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:21,600
It's not you can change
your hairstyle like this.

1038
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:27,980
Don't say that. Otherwise
then don't say that Buta curses.

1039
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:29,560
Brother, don't curse.

1040
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:31,520
We too are just like you from within.

1041
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,810
- Yes.
- This means you too are artists?

1042
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:34,690
- Right.
- Right.

1043
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:36,940
He plays tabla and
he plays harmonium..

1044
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:40,810
Uncle plays drums and I write..
and sometimes sing as well.

1045
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,060
And what does this boy do?

1046
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:43,940
He collects the money on the floor.

1047
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,350
Mr. Chaudhary, what do you do?

1048
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,560
I too am artist just like all of you.

1049
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,600
I am no doctor either.

1050
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,520
- Do you have a pound?
- Yes.

1051
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,810
Throw it over here and
you'll know what Chaudhary does.

1052
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:58,100
- Can you sing?
- Yes.

1053
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,100
You sing and he will dance.

1054
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:01,850
- I don't want to dance.
- Why?

1055
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:05,190
- My teeth are aching.
- Then don't dance on your teeth today.

1056
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,650
Get my diary.

1057
00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:11,600
This is a big deal.
Someone served you right!

1058
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,350
The other one.

1059
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,770
You can settle the accounts later.
Sing us a song first.

1060
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:19,690
I thought you weren't
only blessed with hair..

1061
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:21,440
..but you weren't blessed
with a brain either.

1062
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,270
He has penned his songs in his diary.

1063
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:26,150
Billa, give me the drum.

1064
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:27,940
Give it here.

1065
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:30,230
He says..

1066
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,690
"We escaped the fields
only to end up slogging abroad."

1067
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,650
"We escaped the fields
only to end up slogging abroad."

1068
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:39,770
"We manage stay healthy even
when we are under the weather."

1069
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:42,600
"We manage stay healthy even
when we are under the weather."

1070
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:48,400
"We get tired working
shifts day and night.."

1071
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:51,850
"We escaped the fields
only to end up slogging abroad."

1072
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:55,650
"We escaped the fields
only to end up slogging abroad."

1073
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,980
- Tavrej..
- Yes?

1074
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:07,270
You cannot sleep even though
you don't owe anyone any money?

1075
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:09,310
Don't we have to go meet Kamran?

1076
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:11,480
Why aren't you ready?

1077
00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:14,350
I am feeling sleepy. You go ahead.

1078
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,480
What if he has a girl who
is a citizen already waiting there?

1079
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:18,810
And what if she looks at me and says:

1080
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,940
Handsome,
let's get married today itself.

1081
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,350
I think you too need some more sleep.

1082
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,400
Pour some water over your
head so that you can think clearly.

1083
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,480
- Greetings, brother.
- Greetings.

1084
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,100
- Are you good?
- I'm good.

1085
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,810
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thank you.

1086
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:40,900
I had kept some milk here.

1087
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:43,770
That's why I said thank you.
I used it.

1088
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:46,600
- Not even a little was left?
- Yes, there was a little left.

1089
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:48,730
- Where is it?
- I made coffee from it.

1090
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,560
Then there is none left.
Anyway, I'll get some more milk.

1091
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,650
Tavrej, do you think he
hit me on purpose last night?

1092
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,270
No, you are mistaken.

1093
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,600
It happens when you are high.

1094
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:05,770
Once a man had my alcohol
and then slapped me.

1095
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,350
Tavrej, if you want to have
bread then bring your own jam.

1096
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,770
You used up half the
bottle on one slice of bread.

1097
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,600
Bloody hogger.

1098
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:20,810
I was about to have a heart attack!

1099
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,730
You too want to go to the bathroom?

1100
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:24,810
Yes, I do.
You can go first if you want to.

1101
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:28,100
No, I am getting the pressure,
but I can control.

1102
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:29,480
You are elder to me,
you should go first.

1103
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,310
- No.
- I'll go later.

1104
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,650
No, you go on. Go.

1105
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:35,270
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1106
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,770
Jinder?

1107
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:43,850
Did you fall asleep inside?

1108
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,400
Come out if you are
done with the album.

1109
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,770
His album takes time to finish.

1110
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,480
He takes a lot of retakes.

1111
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:01,310
Jinder, how about
acknowledging me atleast?

1112
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:07,480
There is something
called as patience as well.

1113
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:09,730
There is something
called as shame as well.

1114
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,480
Forget the rent of the room..

1115
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,650
..first let's decide what will
pay me per month for the bathroom.

1116
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:16,440
You say such sweet things,
Mr. Chaudhary.

1117
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,730
Whereas your face resembles an elbow.

1118
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,520
You didn't get it?

1119
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:22,770
Like this.

1120
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:27,810
You can match it and see.

1121
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,940
Caution is necessary.

1122
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,770
Hello?

1123
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:45,100
I forgot, you know Bhola
from the neighbouring village..

1124
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,350
I have sent it with him.

1125
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,980
Take Shinda along and get it.

1126
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,980
He will go to meet his relations soon.

1127
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,350
Then you will have to keep
hunting for him. Yes, okay.

1128
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,100
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

1129
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:58,690
Okay. Bye. Okay.

1130
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:10,060
Jinder Batalvi, don't let your tea go
cold while thinking about the lyrics.

1131
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:13,810
Jinder, is Chaudhary gone?

1132
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,770
Even people like Alexander couldn't
last forever then how can Chaudhary.

1133
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:19,350
Chaudhary is a scoundrel,
he won't die so soon.

1134
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:21,850
How do I send money to Punjab?

1135
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:24,060
Go to a moneytransfer shop.

1136
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:25,980
Take your passport along.

1137
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:27,940
Passport why? I don't want them
to personally go to deliver the money.

1138
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:29,520
I want to send it from here.

1139
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,850
You will need an ID, brother.

1140
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,230
But my passport is with Mr. Khan.

1141
00:58:33,650 --> 00:58:35,650
Then give the money to Mr. Khan,
he will send it.

1142
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:38,350
Brother, give it to me.

1143
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,060
I'll do it when
I'll go to send his money.

1144
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,060
Tell me how much money
do you wish to send?

1145
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:43,440
I want to send 20 pounds.

1146
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,440
All of that is pound?

1147
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,350
Yes, all of it.

1148
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,560
Brother, that's a lot
of cash you are carrying.

1149
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:50,690
You should hire a
gunman for protection.

1150
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:52,440
Learn to shoot and I'll hire you.

1151
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,440
Bloody donkey!

1152
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,100
Then they say that Buta curses.

1153
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,770
Actually my family needed some money.

1154
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:00,810
Brother, 20 pounds is the fees.

1155
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,060
Atleast send 100.

1156
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:04,230
Do what do I do with this?

1157
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:05,940
Put it back in your pocket.

1158
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:07,100
Buta!

1159
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:11,440
We are going to meet Kamran!
Why aren't you ready as yet?

1160
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,650
I am ready. It's not like
I need to wet and set my hair.

1161
00:59:14,730 --> 00:59:17,270
But son, you still need
to shine the surface, don't you?

1162
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:18,350
Brother, please pray for me.

1163
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,190
Yes, please pray for him.
He's getting operated.

1164
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:21,690
Let's go, son. Come on.

1165
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:26,560
Is this the shop?

1166
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:29,770
I think this is the shop.

1167
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:31,810
- Come on, let's go.
- Wait.

1168
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,230
I think we should go back.

1169
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:35,230
You walked all the way
and you want to go back now?

1170
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:36,730
Then they say that Buta curses.

1171
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:38,850
You know, we are only going
to get embarrassed inside.

1172
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,850
Why? Why will we get embarrassed?

1173
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:43,600
When we go inside and
Kamran asks who is he..

1174
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,600
- ..then I will say that
he is my friend. - Yes.

1175
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:47,310
- And you know what he will say to that?
- What will he say?

1176
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,650
That he looks like a thief.

1177
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:50,440
Tavrej!

1178
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:53,270
You won't stop saying this, will you?

1179
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:57,150
You spread this rumour all across
Lahore that I look like a thief.

1180
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:58,850
Even my kids had started hiding
their toys when they say me coming..

1181
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:00,480
..fearing that their
father might steal them.

1182
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:04,810
I check my wallet 50 times
whether I stole something from it.

1183
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,900
Listen, you won't call me
a thief over here.

1184
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,020
I am not crazy to call you a thief.
You are my friend.

1185
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,480
- Why would I call you a thief?
- Yes.

1186
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,020
Can I call you a thief?
You have always lived a decent life.

1187
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:14,520
- You are not a thief.
- Yes.

1188
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,650
Who calls you a thief?
Do you look like a thief?

1189
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:18,480
I'll break their legs if
anyone addresses you as a thief.

1190
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,020
People will only once you stop.

1191
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,480
You just won't stop.

1192
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:25,310
- That's it, I am leaving.
- Wait, wait. You are my brother.

1193
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,980
I'll never call you a thief again.

1194
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:28,730
- "Come with me."
- Okay listen..

1195
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:30,520
There are a lot of things here,
don't flick anything.

1196
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,730
You have come here to
see a girl and not statues.

1197
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:40,560
I'm just checking the designs, son.

1198
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:43,310
Then check out the tall ones,
there no tall ones at your home.

1199
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:46,230
Stop your nonsense. Come with me.

1200
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,150
Kamran?

1201
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,230
- Yes I am Kamran.
- Greetings, uncle.

1202
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:51,690
- Greetings.
- Did you recognise me?

1203
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:53,230
No.

1204
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:54,900
We are meeting for the first time,
how will you recognise me?

1205
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,600
I am Wasim's son, from Pakistan.

1206
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:59,480
How is it possible?
He looks as old as you.

1207
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,980
Actually uncle,
get got married at quiet a young age.

1208
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:05,900
- How young was he?
- On his wedding..

1209
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:07,810
He was the one bursting crackers.

1210
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,600
Yes, I was there.

1211
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:12,100
- He asked me who are you?
- I said I want to be your son.

1212
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:14,600
Come on, uncle. You are so funny.

1213
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:16,400
Anyway, forget it.
Tell me, what do you want?

1214
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,900
A girl who is a citizen.

1215
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,940
If you don't have a citizen
then arrange for two non-citizens.

1216
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:23,520
- Who is he?
- He's my friend.

1217
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:25,730
He looks like a thief.

1218
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:29,980
You told him?
I am a thief? Am I a thief?

1219
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,060
You are not a thief, keep this down.

1220
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:33,850
Uncle, you shouldn't say
such things to someone's face.

1221
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,480
You should take the person to a
corner and whisper it into their ears.

1222
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,440
"Buta, you look like a thief."

1223
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,350
Right?

1224
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,150
Why say such a thing
in the first place?

1225
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:42,980
Then they say that Buta curses.

1226
01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:44,270
Show me a girl.

1227
01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:46,690
I don't have girls on the
shelves here. "Show me a girl!"

1228
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:49,520
And it is difficult in UK to find a female
citizen who is willing to get married.

1229
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,690
It takes time.

1230
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:52,690
It's okay, uncle.
You can take all the time you want.

1231
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:55,310
But she is should be
a citizen and not aged.

1232
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,480
Father also told me to ask for work.

1233
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,100
How can I offer you work,
your papers aren't in order.

1234
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:04,650
You'll either have to do construction
work or go to the fields.

1235
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:06,690
People still go to the fields?

1236
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:09,400
Uncle, we are artists.

1237
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,730
Then I can send you
to the restaurant next door.

1238
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:17,310
"Alarm is ringing, it's morning!"

1239
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:20,600
"You'll lose the job,
if you keep delaying."

1240
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:24,060
"Come on, my boy!"

1241
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:27,100
"Come on, my boy!"

1242
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,850
"Alarm is ringing, it's morning!"

1243
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:34,150
"You'll lose the job,
if you keep delaying."

1244
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:37,600
"Come on, my boy!"

1245
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:40,560
"Come on, my boy!"

1246
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:46,440
"You will have to get
out of the warm blanket.."

1247
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:51,060
"Come on, my boy!"

1248
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:54,400
"Come on, my boy!"

1249
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:57,770
"Come on, my boy!"

1250
01:02:57,850 --> 01:03:00,690
"Come on, my boy!"

1251
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:05,480
"Come on, my boy!"

1252
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,440
"Come on, my boy!"

1253
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:12,230
"Come on, my boy!"

1254
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:15,310
"Come on, my boy!"

1255
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:19,400
"We live abroad.
Even when we are under the weather.."

1256
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,940
- Come. Come.
- Welcome, brother.

1257
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:23,480
- Move back.
- Oh my..

1258
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,900
Jinder you sing so well.

1259
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,810
I am honestly your fan.

1260
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,060
Wonderful. Mr. Chaudhary,
do you know singing too?

1261
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:31,560
- I do.
- Then sing something for us.

1262
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:32,850
I don't know how to sing.

1263
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:34,190
Come down here.

1264
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:36,150
We are all sitting down here
while you are sitting up there.

1265
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,400
- Okay.
- Come on.

1266
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,730
- Here he comes.
- There he comes.

1267
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,020
Here comes Chaudhary.

1268
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,020
- Wow!
- Talk to me.

1269
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:43,520
Cover your legs.

1270
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:46,020
- Okay. - If Chaudhary
bites you, you'll get boils.

1271
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:49,440
Hello, I make decisions
for the whole village.

1272
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,560
Such Chaudharys cry
before making a decision.

1273
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:52,730
- Why?
- Why?

1274
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:54,150
I cannot do this.

1275
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,520
Such Chaudharys cannot bend well.

1276
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,150
They tell boys to milk the cattle.

1277
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:03,520
If you are done making fun of me
then let's get down to business.

1278
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,270
- Go ahead. - We are joking around
because we don't have any work tomorrow.

1279
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:07,770
That's why I am saying this.

1280
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:10,150
I have a job for one
person in the morning.

1281
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:11,770
Who would want to take it on?

1282
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:12,650
You want to go?

1283
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:13,480
- No.
- Buta, you?

1284
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:15,400
No, I have a labour job for tomorrow.

1285
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,440
Fine, then I'll go with you.

1286
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,900
If you don't wake up
on time in the morning..

1287
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:21,480
..then I shall put hot water on you.

1288
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:23,100
I'll wake up, Mr. Chaudhary..

1289
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,060
May God bless you with a long life.
I hope you get up.

1290
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:28,650
Shut up. Caution is necessary.

1291
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:03,060
Jinder!

1292
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:08,940
How about a selfie?

1293
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,100
- You too join in, uncle.
- Please come.

1294
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:18,230
Smile!

1295
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:23,980
- Very good. You look good.
- Thank you.

1296
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,730
Can I get a straw?

1297
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:32,440
Your lipstick won't come off.

1298
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:33,850
Drink it.

1299
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:40,480
I thought no one would recognise me.
I would get good money too.

1300
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:42,350
So what if anyone recognises you?

1301
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,690
You are working hard for it.

1302
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:48,100
You won't believe it but when I first
came to UK I have even dug graves.

1303
01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:51,650
Not for real, right?

1304
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:52,940
For real.

1305
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:54,980
It is not easy to pay fees.

1306
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,810
Why did you have to
take up tough courses?

1307
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,060
You could have learnt
embroidery or something.

1308
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:02,440
Just because you're
a boy you can do anything?

1309
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:05,980
Tell me something,
what will you do with all this money?

1310
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,190
Do you have kids back in Punjab?

1311
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,980
I'll have kids in UK.

1312
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:11,270
British born.

1313
01:06:11,810 --> 01:06:14,940
- I want to marry here.
- Why are you already betrothed?

1314
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,690
I'm destined to.

1315
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:28,520
"You never heard rain romancing
the grounds, I think.."

1316
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:34,850
"I think you have never
heard the peacock sing."

1317
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:41,190
"You have no clue how many
times I sought your attention."

1318
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:47,230
"You have no clue how many
times I sought your attention."

1319
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:53,400
"Flowers add fragrance our path.."

1320
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:57,770
"Flowers add fragrance.."

1321
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:05,980
What's with so much oil? Do
you plan to fry fritters on my head?

1322
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:07,850
Ouch!

1323
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:10,900
Tell me something?
What do you think about Jinder?

1324
01:07:11,350 --> 01:07:14,600
You are talking about the maestro!
You're going in the right direction.

1325
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:21,560
Bal, you know that my father is dead
and my brother is younger than me.

1326
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:23,770
Mother is always worried about me.

1327
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:25,520
That's why I feel scared.

1328
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,850
And it is justified to be feel scared.

1329
01:07:27,190 --> 01:07:28,440
Jinder is a nice boy.

1330
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:30,810
He is hard working as well.
But he isn't citizen.

1331
01:07:31,350 --> 01:07:34,520
That's not an issue. Not everyone
who aren't a citizen are the same.

1332
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,150
We too were not a citizens once.

1333
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:38,690
If you have thought so much
then why wait, go and talk to him.

1334
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:42,600
We did 23 shifts, brother.

1335
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:43,980
You must have.

1336
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:46,900
But I can't pay you anything from my
pocket if the company doesn't pay me.

1337
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,690
We worked for three weeks,
pay at least for one.

1338
01:07:49,730 --> 01:07:51,150
You know how difficult
it to so survive out here.

1339
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:52,600
Why just one,
he has to pay for all three.

1340
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:55,310
I won't even pay for a single shift.
Do whatever you can.

1341
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:02,020
I'd have taught you a lesson
if my papers were in order.

1342
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:05,980
Saw how he spoke to us?

1343
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,060
He kept begging us to work for him.

1344
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:09,730
It's okay.

1345
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:12,600
It's not okay!
My father took a loan to send me here.

1346
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:15,650
Moneylenders are at
our doorstep every day!

1347
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:17,350
He never got cursed otherwise.

1348
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,980
But he is being cursed now,
because of me.

1349
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:21,150
Here we have to beg for our own money.

1350
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:23,600
We stay hungry, we work long shifts!
Tell me, what are we doing wrong!

1351
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:25,150
Tell me, what else should we do!

1352
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,940
We work so hard!

1353
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:28,350
And we don't even
get the money we deserve!

1354
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:32,850
You keep eating the
same things every day.

1355
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:34,520
Don't you get anything
to eat at the restaurant?

1356
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,060
I'm on a diet.
I am going to get married in UK.

1357
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:41,150
You don't need to diet for that,
you only need to have a good face.

1358
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,310
Then how did you
manage to get married?

1359
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:44,810
Because of my elders.

1360
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:47,560
If you look this ugly,
I am sure your elders look worse.

1361
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,900
Pour only as much as you can eat.

1362
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:03,020
Let's have tea.

1363
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,730
Great.

1364
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:14,150
- Looks like you scored big today.
- Oh yes.

1365
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:17,440
Come here, brother..
don't sit with a beggar.

1366
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,940
What are you saying, brother?
He's an artist.

1367
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:23,020
Doesn't anyone give you notes?

1368
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,940
Our department doesn't accept notes.

1369
01:09:25,310 --> 01:09:28,310
Breeze blows them away.

1370
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,900
Why don't you buy some
milk if you want to have it?

1371
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:37,560
We need to spend money to get milk here,
there is no cattle tied in the backyard!

1372
01:09:37,650 --> 01:09:39,480
I think he realised there is no milk.

1373
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,100
They are always having milk.

1374
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:42,520
Why don't you be
considerate of others?

1375
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:44,600
Everyone here wants to trouble us.

1376
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:47,190
The employee doesn't pay and
they here think they own everything.

1377
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:50,850
We spend our money to get
the milk and they consume it.

1378
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,600
Clean up, work hard
and get milk for them!

1379
01:09:58,190 --> 01:10:00,310
Learn to live property!

1380
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:06,520
Gaffer didn't pay up.

1381
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,770
He will be fine by evening.

1382
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:12,230
You look ugly even
when you are this close.

1383
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:41,310
One cappuccino.

1384
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:43,440
Maestro!

1385
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,980
Don't say it in front of everyone.

1386
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:47,230
What if everyone knows?
I cannot just teach everyone!

1387
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:49,150
- Anyway, what's up!
- Sorry.

1388
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:51,600
What bring you here today?

1389
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:53,190
I was going to work.

1390
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,350
So I thought I'll have
some coffee before I leave.

1391
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,020
Bal.. Make us one nice cup of coffee!

1392
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,230
Why? Are you two going to share?

1393
01:11:00,310 --> 01:11:02,230
Don't make me whack you!
Get the coffee!

1394
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:03,270
Okay.

1395
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,100
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1396
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:13,560
Jinder, may I ask something?

1397
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:17,940
Are you going to spend
your life like this..

1398
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:19,900
..or have you thought
something about your future?

1399
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,900
I want to become
a citizen at any cost.

1400
01:11:26,150 --> 01:11:28,730
I'll settle down with
a girl who is a citizen.

1401
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:33,690
What about you?

1402
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:36,060
Same here.

1403
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,060
I too am not a citizen.

1404
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:45,940
It's okay, don't feel disheartened.

1405
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:48,440
I know many boys.

1406
01:11:48,770 --> 01:11:51,690
I'll keep you in mind if I come
across a nice boy who is a citizen.

1407
01:11:53,770 --> 01:11:55,940
You too might be coming
across many girls.

1408
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:57,560
Keep in mind and let me know
if there is a girl who is a citizen.

1409
01:11:57,650 --> 01:11:59,310
I am even ready to pay.

1410
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,560
Sure.

1411
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:03,230
Okay then, I'm getting late for work.

1412
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:08,350
- Bye.
- Bye.

1413
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,600
- Savy, may I say something?
- Yes?

1414
01:12:12,230 --> 01:12:13,690
You are a very nice girl.

1415
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:17,150
If I didn't have to become a citizen..

1416
01:12:18,190 --> 01:12:19,850
..then I would have
married you for sure.

1417
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:34,600
They sit idle.
They don't do their work.

1418
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:35,810
They have nothing to do.

1419
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:38,310
They eat and leave.
We don't have maids here.

1420
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,810
One should do their own dishes.

1421
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:41,400
What do you think you are here for?

1422
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,020
I am here to do your dishes?

1423
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:47,060
- What happened?
- Look, you didn't need to interfere.

1424
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:48,560
It was a small quarrel.

1425
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:51,350
Billa, please wash them,
it's not like you'll chip a nail.

1426
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,350
This is a limit,
why can't he wash them?

1427
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,520
Fine, I'll wash them
if I feel like next time.

1428
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:58,350
You can wash your utensils
whenever you feel like.

1429
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:00,480
Hello! No violence.

1430
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,310
These utensils belong to me.

1431
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:04,060
Careful, Billa.

1432
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,690
Do you know how he
gathered these utensils?

1433
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:09,020
Is it easy to stand under the sun?

1434
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:11,230
Like you have come
from a hill station!

1435
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:14,560
That's why I am saying,
caution is necessary.

1436
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,310
Caution is fine, but we aren't
here to do their dirty dishes.

1437
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,850
Do your own dishes.

1438
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:20,560
Leave them if you
don't want to wash them.

1439
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,230
Divide the utensils.

1440
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:23,600
- This is fine.
- Okay then.

1441
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:25,770
Why stop at utensils,
divide everything.

1442
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:27,810
- That's fine too.
- It will save us a lot of milk.

1443
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:30,560
And don't turn the
bathroom into a library.

1444
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,690
The one who wants to write
songs can write them outside.

1445
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:34,940
Write them outside? But I
don't hit the right notes outside.

1446
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:36,690
- That's fine.
- This is my vest.

1447
01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:38,060
Take it.

1448
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:41,310
By the way,
why are we getting separated?

1449
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:43,310
I swear, I too don't know.

1450
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:18,600
No!

1451
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:22,310
What happened? Are they
distributing something inside?

1452
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:24,060
Do you have anything inside?

1453
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,520
I'll go next.

1454
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,980
One of yours followed by one of ours.

1455
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:30,900
After you, two of ours can go.

1456
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:33,190
This is a place where
two cannot go together.

1457
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,440
Great!

1458
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,940
You are such a smart man.

1459
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:41,600
If I weren't in a hurry,
I would've rewarded you.

1460
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:50,440
Mr. Chaudhary..

1461
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,440
Say something.

1462
01:14:58,810 --> 01:15:01,480
Why aren't you drinking it?
Just pour and have it.

1463
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:03,810
He has marked it. Bloody miser!

1464
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,150
Oh, I see.

1465
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:06,810
We will have to get our own milk now.

1466
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:11,310
How much longer will you take?

1467
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,940
I need to make a few omelettes.

1468
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:14,900
- It will take me some time.
- Not a few.

1469
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:17,270
You will make one then I'll make one.

1470
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:18,650
Oh, I see.

1471
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:32,600
This onion is made from stone,
its tough to cut.

1472
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:36,940
Take an onion like this..

1473
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,600
And cut them like this.

1474
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,560
- And cut it like this.
- Okay.

1475
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:46,600
- You are cutting big pieces.
- I'm not talking to you.

1476
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:48,690
Oh.

1477
01:15:48,770 --> 01:15:52,020
By the way,
one can cook a meal in this much time.

1478
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:57,400
- Uncle?
- Yes?

1479
01:15:57,810 --> 01:15:59,690
- Don't put me on the roster today.
- Why?

1480
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:01,350
I'm going to sign.

1481
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:03,400
Maybe they might deport me.

1482
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,520
Can't you say something good instead?

1483
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:07,100
They won't send you anywhere.

1484
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:09,440
People like you are not needed there.

1485
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:15,310
Everything else is fine,
but just in case..

1486
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:18,270
If father calls,
tell him, I'm working.

1487
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:22,190
Give me my boots at least.

1488
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,440
They are new.

1489
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:25,150
Who know whether or
not you will come back.

1490
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:27,400
Fine, pray for your shoes then.

1491
01:16:28,270 --> 01:16:29,560
And maybe I too will come back.

1492
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:34,100
You will come back.
Nothing is going to happen to you.

1493
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,770
Bye.

1494
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:47,060
What are you doing? Tea is ready.

1495
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:50,980
I was about to call up Tavrej.

1496
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:53,600
"God has given me such a fate!"

1497
01:16:58,520 --> 01:16:59,770
Who is calling me?

1498
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:02,480
Hello? Who is it?

1499
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,270
People address me as your father.

1500
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:05,810
Greetings, father.

1501
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:08,150
- Where are you?
- At work.

1502
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:10,850
- What work?
- I am the prime minister of UK now.

1503
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,600
The person you sent me to
has got me working in a restaurant.

1504
01:17:13,690 --> 01:17:15,190
- I'm cleaning up.
- Cleaning up? With what?

1505
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:16,730
I'm mopping with a sword.

1506
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:18,100
Damn you.

1507
01:17:18,190 --> 01:17:21,400
Do you want to insult me on purpose?
You know what one uses to clean up.

1508
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,980
We never know it with you.

1509
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:24,350
You can clean anything with anything!

1510
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,940
Fear God, father. What are you saying?

1511
01:17:27,020 --> 01:17:29,270
It's not Pakistan that police
will show up after seven days.

1512
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:30,770
They come within five minutes here.

1513
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:33,560
They handcuff you and then hold you by
the neck and load you into their car.

1514
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:38,230
Fine, don't joke around. Now tell me
are you wearing nice clothes to work?

1515
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:40,270
Father, clothes don't
get dirty over here.

1516
01:17:40,350 --> 01:17:43,190
Here you have to put a stain on purpose
otherwise nothing catches stain.

1517
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:44,810
Anyway, why are you
asking about my clothes?

1518
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:47,690
Kamran has found a girl for you.

1519
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:51,060
Go and meet him immediately.

1520
01:17:51,150 --> 01:17:54,310
Don't worry, father.
You have given birth to a Spiderman.

1521
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,900
I'll be before Kamran
as soon as you hang up.

1522
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,980
I wonder what kind of
a girl has Kamran found me.

1523
01:18:10,690 --> 01:18:11,650
Date of birth?

1524
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13,770
24th August 1987.

1525
01:18:14,770 --> 01:18:17,560
- Greetings, uncle.
- Greetings.

1526
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,150
Who is this miss?

1527
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:21,060
She is a citizen here.

1528
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:23,060
- The one you found for me?
- Yes.

1529
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:26,810
I would have agreed even
if she wasn't a citizen.

1530
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:30,350
- Where did you find this angel?
- From Poland.

1531
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:32,850
You two will need to get married
to get the papers in order.

1532
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:34,810
She should just agree to marry me.

1533
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:36,690
I already feel like a citizen.

1534
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:40,190
- How are you?
- Hello! She doesn't know Urdu.

1535
01:18:40,270 --> 01:18:42,730
Uncle, no language
is a barrier for love.

1536
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:47,690
Her eyes say, "Tavrej, take me away!
I am in need!"

1537
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:50,150
"Tavrej, take me away! I am in need!"

1538
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:52,400
Keep your hands away,
she is indeed in need.

1539
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,270
She wanted 15, I confirmed it at 12.

1540
01:18:55,350 --> 01:18:56,230
- Really?
- Yes.

1541
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:57,900
No problem,
I'll talk to father right away.

1542
01:18:57,980 --> 01:18:58,940
- Fine, talk to him.
- Okay.

1543
01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:00,900
- Father praises you a lot.
- Really?

1544
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:02,480
You can hear him now.

1545
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,060
- Hello!
- Greetings, father.

1546
01:19:09,150 --> 01:19:13,650
You can greet me later, first tell me
did you talk to that donkey?

1547
01:19:13,730 --> 01:19:14,850
Who donkey, father?

1548
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:17,900
The donkey you were
going to meet at Kamran's..

1549
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:19,440
Hold on, father.

1550
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,560
What are you doing, father!
She is right in front of me.

1551
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:24,020
Father is praising you.

1552
01:19:24,270 --> 01:19:27,900
Now tell him that now it will be 15
for the praises he just said.

1553
01:19:27,980 --> 01:19:30,850
Father, one word by you
has increase the price by 3000.

1554
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:34,690
The way you curse, I think you will have
to spend 40 to get a daughter-in-law.

1555
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:36,020
I want to talk to him.

1556
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:38,400
Yes.
You should be cautious, father.

1557
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,020
He wants to talk to you.

1558
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:43,480
Hello?

1559
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:47,230
You know that Chaudhary
Wasim has a lot of money.

1560
01:19:47,310 --> 01:19:50,650
I'll transfer as much as you want
into your account whenever you say.

1561
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:52,100
But remember one thing.

1562
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,440
My son should become
a legal citizen there.

1563
01:19:55,650 --> 01:19:59,310
Okay, fine. Don't worry,
go do your job and I'll handle this.

1564
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,560
Okay, bye.

1565
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:03,810
I spoke to him.

1566
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:04,940
- Is it done?
- It is done.

1567
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:06,350
- The deal is done?
- Done.

1568
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,770
- So does this mean she is mine?
- Yes, she is.

1569
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:11,850
The deal is done.
It's absolutely done!

1570
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:14,600
How are you, neighbours?

1571
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,400
Get me a coffee from
your staff's quota.

1572
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:19,480
Stopped offering staff coffee.

1573
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:20,520
Oh really?

1574
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:23,150
Is it only for me
or are you too starving?

1575
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,060
Maestro!

1576
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:29,730
God bless you!
May your poems get published.

1577
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:31,480
Did you find a citizen for yourself?

1578
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:37,020
You told her too?

1579
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:39,690
Good, now both of
you look for one for me.

1580
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:42,020
I anyway don't realise
who is or isn't a citizen.

1581
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,650
- Did you close the till,
it's four o'clock. - Yes.

1582
01:20:46,190 --> 01:20:47,310
It's four o'clock?

1583
01:20:50,350 --> 01:20:55,400
Hello uncle, did my shoes return?

1584
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,560
Okay.

1585
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,480
Looks like you are
shopping for the wedding.

1586
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:05,440
No, Billa has gone to sign.

1587
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,350
He has worn my shoes.

1588
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:11,190
See you then.
Okay, bye. I'll go find out.

1589
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:17,850
He is no maestro,
he's worried about his shoes.

1590
01:21:18,230 --> 01:21:21,020
He isn't worried about his shoes.
He is worried about Billa.

1591
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,060
- Billa?
- Billa isn't home as yet?

1592
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,270
You are sitting back here?
I've been looking for you inside.

1593
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:49,480
There comes that idiot!

1594
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:51,350
So.. what did the cops ask?

1595
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:53,650
Nothing, uncle.
They kept me waiting at first.

1596
01:21:53,730 --> 01:21:55,440
Then they made me
sign and sent me away.

1597
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:56,850
A lot of Indians are over there.

1598
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:58,480
- Uncle, I met a boy from your village.
- Is it?

1599
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,350
Everyone remembers their own number.

1600
01:22:01,310 --> 01:22:03,810
You could have borrowed
someone's phone and inform us.

1601
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,020
What happened, brother?

1602
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,400
Are you alright?

1603
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,650
Wash my shoes.

1604
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:12,730
I want to wear them
day after tomorrow.

1605
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:13,810
I'll wash them.

1606
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:15,020
Also wash your jacket.

1607
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:16,230
It was last washed in Punjab, I think.

1608
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:17,730
- Do you want some tea?
- Make it.

1609
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:20,150
Did Buta drink all the milk?

1610
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:22,270
He cannot be trusted, uncle.

1611
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,300
Your father has
a great network out here.

1612
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:32,300
He found you a girl
in just one week!

1613
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:33,680
Right!

1614
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,140
People have been living here
for 15 years.

1615
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:38,760
They keep dyeing their beard.
But they didn't become a citizen.

1616
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:43,670
Uncle, he is talking about you.

1617
01:22:46,090 --> 01:22:47,220
Wait.

1618
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:55,510
Karnail, didn't you say there
is a girl who'd marry for 15,000?

1619
01:22:56,670 --> 01:22:59,050
Find me two at the
rate of 10,000 each.

1620
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:01,220
Yes, we will get both
the boys citizenship.

1621
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:04,840
- Buta!
- Yes.

1622
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:06,760
Don't you think you're paying
too much for sister-in-law?

1623
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,380
We will pay in instalments.

1624
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,340
I have a friend.

1625
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:15,090
All the songs written
by him have been superhit.

1626
01:23:15,170 --> 01:23:20,670
I have also come across such lyricists
who have written so many songs..

1627
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,970
..but yet haven't been
able to release a single song.

1628
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:26,920
There are still people here
who came years ago..

1629
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:30,970
..but they still stand at the
juncture like a electrocuted rat.

1630
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,470
- Who is he calling a rat?
- You are the rat among us.

1631
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:39,880
- He is calling me a rat?
- You stand at the juncture.

1632
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:44,090
There was a drummer in our village
he plays amazingly, no repeats.

1633
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:47,880
And here there are people playing
the same beat since 15 years.

1634
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:49,340
They don't know anything else.

1635
01:23:49,420 --> 01:23:52,050
I can beat everything..

1636
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:55,170
But I don't remember
where I kept my sticks.

1637
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:58,090
It must be here somewhere, uncle.
Check on the bed.

1638
01:23:59,870 --> 01:24:01,510
Is he calling me a stick now?

1639
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:03,380
Among us, you are the
one who looks like a stick.

1640
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,920
- Is he calling me a stick?
- You are the one on the bed.

1641
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:10,510
Some people here claim
to have ice factories..

1642
01:24:10,590 --> 01:24:13,670
..for all we know his father
sells ice candies on the streets.

1643
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:17,640
Did you see an icicle?

1644
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,720
That too is on the bed I think.

1645
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:25,170
I swear, he means you.

1646
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,340
- He is saying it to me?
- Yes.

1647
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:32,590
Some people keep making
fun of an innocent person.

1648
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:35,880
There are some other
brainless beasts here as well.

1649
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:37,590
- Like him.
- Shut up.

1650
01:24:37,670 --> 01:24:39,170
Then they say Buta curses.

1651
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:40,970
Did you have to divert
their attention towards me?

1652
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:43,800
Shut up and go to sleep.
You have nothing else to do.

1653
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:46,510
You will wake up
and leave for work.

1654
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:49,260
I will have to work hard
to stay idle the whole day.

1655
01:24:58,970 --> 01:25:00,510
Who is it? Oh!

1656
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,890
In our village..

1657
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:08,260
..people go to bed early..

1658
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:17,830
How much advance did the
Marriage Palace owner take? - 50?

1659
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:20,670
- And three for the jeweller.
- Fine, okay. Yes.

1660
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:24,270
Ask Balli to make me talk
to them over the phone, okay?

1661
01:25:24,350 --> 01:25:25,340
Fine.

1662
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:28,010
Yes. I have spoken to Shaunki.

1663
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:30,840
We will pay for the clothes
after the wedding. Okay?

1664
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,510
And make sure one of
our men supervise the cooks.

1665
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:35,420
They will otherwise cut corners.

1666
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:36,180
Fine.

1667
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:38,670
I've cooked the meals.

1668
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,670
Billa, laundry my
clothes as well. Okay?

1669
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:43,420
Yes. Let me talk to the cook.

1670
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:44,800
It's not like we have never
had a wedding at home.

1671
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,470
And listen, have you given
invites to all the relatives?

1672
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:49,470
I don't anyone getting upset.

1673
01:25:49,550 --> 01:25:51,550
Fine, I'll talk to you later.
I'm going to work now.

1674
01:25:51,630 --> 01:25:53,220
Okay, fine, talk to you later.
- Okay.

1675
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:55,340
No, just take care of mother.

1676
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:57,970
Everything else is fine.
Don't worry.

1677
01:25:58,050 --> 01:26:01,720
She is surviving solely
because of the medicines now.

1678
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:05,010
Spend some more money.

1679
01:26:05,090 --> 01:26:06,220
Okay, okay..

1680
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:08,550
We need to go to the
doctor again next week.

1681
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:09,920
- No, don't worry at all.
- Buta!

1682
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:11,010
Okay.

1683
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:13,470
- Is the washing machine busy?
- No, I have tied cattle around it.

1684
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:16,220
I have put clothes on wash. I am
standing right here. Can't you see?

1685
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:18,670
- How much time will it take?
- Some time.

1686
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,010
Around 5-7 hours.

1687
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:21,720
Let's go.
We will do it once we come back.

1688
01:26:23,410 --> 01:26:26,300
The rest of it..
when the guests come over..

1689
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:30,010
..make sure that they are well looked
after and that nothing is amiss. Okay?

1690
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:57,670
Not every father is
destined to have a daughter.

1691
01:26:58,420 --> 01:26:59,970
I had prayed for one.

1692
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,760
And I couldn't even
attend her wedding.

1693
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:14,120
"Happiness and problems
are in his hands."

1694
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:21,460
"He gives what he wishes. You keep on moving but all is in the hands of God."

1695
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:28,180
"If you believe in God
then you never feel dejected."

1696
01:28:36,850 --> 01:28:43,330
"You need to stay where
God has destined you to. "

1697
01:28:43,790 --> 01:28:49,130
"You need to stay where
God has destined you to. "

1698
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:08,300
Savy, where is Jinder these days?

1699
01:29:09,130 --> 01:29:10,170
I don't know.

1700
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:11,760
He wanted to become
a citizen, right?

1701
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:13,340
He might want to. I don't care.

1702
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:14,840
I know a girl.

1703
01:29:15,170 --> 01:29:17,380
She said she would take money
and make Jinder a citizen.

1704
01:29:17,630 --> 01:29:19,130
Why do we need to
make him a citizen?

1705
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:21,130
But you had said he is a good man.

1706
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:23,720
If he comes a citizen then
he can do something for himself.

1707
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,220
You don't want to marry him.

1708
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:26,550
So someone else will, right?

1709
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:28,800
Here, call him up.

1710
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:31,470
Do it.

1711
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:34,220
What time does the
girl want to meet him?

1712
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:35,340
Five o'clock.

1713
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:38,300
He's not idle.
He's always at work.

1714
01:29:38,510 --> 01:29:39,670
I don't think he will come.

1715
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:41,340
Atleast call him up.

1716
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:58,720
- Hello?
- Where are you?

1717
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,840
In the office,
I just need to send a few emails.

1718
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:03,470
Are you sending the emails or
slicing them. Switch off the saw.

1719
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,510
- Tell me.
- You wanted to become a citizen, right?

1720
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:11,220
What do you mean by wanted?
I still want to.

1721
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:13,590
There is a girl. She will
take money to make you a citizen.

1722
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:14,630
Will you pay her?

1723
01:30:15,010 --> 01:30:17,050
Yes, yes, yes, sounds good.

1724
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:18,970
Can you come at my
work place at five today?

1725
01:30:19,050 --> 01:30:20,420
At five?

1726
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:24,880
Don't you think it's too late? Shall
we meet at half past four instead?

1727
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:27,420
- Fine. Okay, bye. See you.
- Bye.

1728
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:28,880
What does he say?
He cannot make it?

1729
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:30,220
He's coming at half past four.

1730
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:34,750
He wants to become a citizen,
not raise a family!

1731
01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:36,160
Boys agree to it.

1732
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:38,290
I know Jinder. He won't.

1733
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:41,410
He'll say no immediately.
And he will scold us too.

1734
01:30:41,870 --> 01:30:44,000
You can hear your maestro curse.

1735
01:30:44,890 --> 01:30:46,970
How are you? How do I look?

1736
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:49,870
Should I keep the
jacket on or take it off?

1737
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,170
No. Keep it on.

1738
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:53,040
Where is she?

1739
01:30:55,790 --> 01:30:56,710
There..

1740
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:02,350
The kid?

1741
01:31:02,730 --> 01:31:03,690
It's hers.

1742
01:31:08,060 --> 01:31:09,490
You had to embarrass us.

1743
01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:14,080
Hello. I'm Jinder.

1744
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:15,790
She must have told you about me.

1745
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:17,830
Your baby?

1746
01:31:23,050 --> 01:31:24,260
- What's his name?
- Avi.

1747
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:25,360
Avi!

1748
01:31:25,450 --> 01:31:26,900
It's okay. Consider it done.

1749
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:27,990
What's up!

1750
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:31,070
She is okay,
give her 15,000 pounds.

1751
01:31:31,150 --> 01:31:32,530
Five as advance and ten later.

1752
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:35,360
15,000 is a lot.
Can you bring it down?

1753
01:31:35,850 --> 01:31:38,610
Look, I am here to stay. I am not
going to leave you after the wedding.

1754
01:31:38,830 --> 01:31:41,330
It's okay, let it be, if you think it
is too much. She isn't an idler either.

1755
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:43,910
- She is a busy woman.
- No, no, no.

1756
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:45,880
Consider it done. Finalise it.

1757
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:51,490
Just take a little more time.
I will take it. don't worry.

1758
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:24,260
- Hello?
- Greetings.

1759
01:32:24,570 --> 01:32:26,160
Hello, sister-in-law.

1760
01:32:27,110 --> 01:32:28,410
Buta has gone to the washroom.

1761
01:32:28,490 --> 01:32:31,960
Brother, ask him to
send money home somehow.

1762
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:34,070
Mother is not well.

1763
01:32:34,150 --> 01:32:35,970
Yes, I'll tell him.

1764
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:42,920
Sister-in-law has called,
talk to her.

1765
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:45,380
My wife? Why did you answer it?

1766
01:32:45,470 --> 01:32:47,470
- It kept on ringing, so I answered it.
- Just because it was ringing?

1767
01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:50,170
Don't you know you are not supposed
to answer anyone's personal phone?

1768
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:53,800
- So what if I answered it?
- Yes, so what happened!

1769
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:55,850
Your elders didn't
teach you any sense?

1770
01:32:55,930 --> 01:32:57,380
They gave you a visa instead.

1771
01:32:57,670 --> 01:32:59,550
Why did you answer
a call from my house?

1772
01:32:59,630 --> 01:33:01,130
Then they say that Buta curses.

1773
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:03,380
Buta, don't make me curse you.

1774
01:33:03,730 --> 01:33:05,420
Call back. It's urgent.

1775
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,460
What happened?
Did you have a nightmare?

1776
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:13,690
Shut up!

1777
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:17,130
I was going to get
married in my dreams.

1778
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:19,170
- I woke up because of you.
- Go back to sleep!

1779
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:20,260
Okay.

1780
01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:24,340
Hello?

1781
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:26,970
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

1782
01:33:27,050 --> 01:33:30,300
Why did you need to talk
when a stranger answered the phone?

1783
01:33:30,380 --> 01:33:32,880
You don't call for
two days at a stretch.

1784
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:34,670
We would be facing
an emergency at home.

1785
01:33:34,810 --> 01:33:36,800
- Is mother alright?
- How does it concern you?

1786
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:39,540
Like you called and
enquired about her health.

1787
01:33:40,010 --> 01:33:41,010
How do I call?

1788
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:44,590
I can only call when I get a job
and start making some money.

1789
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:49,590
Whenever I call,
I start getting worried.

1790
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:51,720
When you tell me everything.

1791
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:55,420
Doctor said that we need to get mother
operated as soon as possible.

1792
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:57,260
How much money will it require?

1793
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,170
I don't know.

1794
01:34:00,010 --> 01:34:02,720
I'll do something.

1795
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,880
I hope you don't once again resort
to not calling home for two days.

1796
01:34:05,470 --> 01:34:07,130
I'll do something soon.

1797
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:08,800
Shall I make a video call?

1798
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:10,340
You will get to see mother.

1799
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:13,340
No. I cannot make a video call.

1800
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:18,340
I cannot sleep when
I look at mother.

1801
01:34:18,710 --> 01:34:19,880
Goodbye.

1802
01:34:39,610 --> 01:34:41,120
I seek your blessings, maestro.

1803
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:42,950
Where's your friend?
She's not taking my calls.

1804
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:44,860
- She is right here.
- Can I talk to her?

1805
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:46,240
Sure.

1806
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:51,110
Hey.. maestro is calling.

1807
01:34:52,610 --> 01:34:53,780
I'm busy.

1808
01:34:54,610 --> 01:34:56,450
Who knows he too might
be sad like you are.

1809
01:34:56,530 --> 01:34:57,610
At least talk to him.

1810
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:00,320
Who says that I am sad?
I didn't meet him.

1811
01:35:00,570 --> 01:35:01,740
Who knows,
maybe he wants to meet you.

1812
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:04,740
Boys are slow.
Atleast talk to him.

1813
01:35:09,990 --> 01:35:11,360
- Hello?
- Can we meet?

1814
01:35:11,780 --> 01:35:13,410
Tell me over the phone itself.

1815
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:15,450
No, I want to meet you.

1816
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:17,660
Okay.

1817
01:35:17,950 --> 01:35:18,820
Okay.

1818
01:35:19,410 --> 01:35:20,410
What does he say?

1819
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:22,820
He wants to meet.

1820
01:35:22,990 --> 01:35:26,240
Yes! I told you,
he wants to meet you.

1821
01:35:26,530 --> 01:35:28,860
Now you get dressed
like a beautiful girl.

1822
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:30,240
Don't go like this.

1823
01:35:30,570 --> 01:35:32,860
Why should I dress up?
I'll go like this only.

1824
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:34,700
Maestro.

1825
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:46,860
Coming.

1826
01:35:48,030 --> 01:35:49,610
I'll be right back. Handle this.

1827
01:35:54,910 --> 01:35:57,030
- How are you?
- Good. How about you?

1828
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:58,320
You are working here?

1829
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,990
Yes, I saw an empty plot.

1830
01:36:01,070 --> 01:36:02,910
I thought I should make homes and sell
them as I have nothing else to do.

1831
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:05,450
Careful, don't end
up selling the whole of UK.

1832
01:36:05,530 --> 01:36:07,450
Spare some land
for the Queen as well.

1833
01:36:07,530 --> 01:36:09,360
I will, if you take the guarantee.

1834
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:13,490
What did you want to talk about?

1835
01:36:15,610 --> 01:36:17,240
I don't know how to say it.

1836
01:36:17,410 --> 01:36:20,690
You keep talking non-stop otherwise.
Now you don't know how to say it?

1837
01:36:21,570 --> 01:36:22,820
Tell me, what is it?

1838
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:26,570
I need 2000 pounds.

1839
01:36:29,530 --> 01:36:32,110
I need to give money to that girl and take
things forward. She is waiting for it.

1840
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:36,160
You wanted to meet me
in order to borrow money?

1841
01:36:36,490 --> 01:36:37,240
Yes.

1842
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:39,200
- That's why you called me?
- Yes.

1843
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:43,070
You know people don't take your
calls after you ask them for money.

1844
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:44,660
I thought of talking
to you face to face..

1845
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:46,530
..you will at least
feel ashamed to refuse me.

1846
01:36:46,610 --> 01:36:48,200
You should feel ashamed.

1847
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:50,410
You are asking money
from me to pay that auntie!

1848
01:36:50,490 --> 01:36:52,320
Hey hello, don't call her auntie!

1849
01:36:52,910 --> 01:36:54,570
I don't have money
because I helped a friend.

1850
01:36:54,660 --> 01:36:56,280
Otherwise,
I had arranged for the money.

1851
01:36:57,860 --> 01:36:59,860
That poor woman is
waiting for my money.

1852
01:36:59,950 --> 01:37:01,320
Let's give her the
money and end this.

1853
01:37:01,700 --> 01:37:03,080
Unbelievable.

1854
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:14,110
"Come on, my son. come on."

1855
01:37:14,740 --> 01:37:15,990
I think I asked for too much.

1856
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:22,380
Why are you doing the cooking?

1857
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:23,800
Where's our chef?

1858
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,550
Uncle has gone out for some work.

1859
01:37:25,630 --> 01:37:27,960
- Did you send the money?
- Yes, I did.

1860
01:37:28,670 --> 01:37:30,250
How are you, Buta? How's it going on?

1861
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:31,920
He's been going on
since quite some time.

1862
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:34,170
This is all he can do,
it's not like he works in a bank.

1863
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:37,130
Like you are coming here
straight from your TESCO shop..

1864
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:38,960
..after settling its accounts, right?

1865
01:37:39,050 --> 01:37:40,960
No, I am yet to settle TESCO's accounts.

1866
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:42,500
I saw a person there.

1867
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:43,840
He looked like a thief?

1868
01:37:45,050 --> 01:37:48,630
Mind your language!
Then don't say that I didn't warn you.

1869
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:51,250
What did he tell you?
Did he hit your head with a stick?

1870
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:54,000
Let him do it.
Let him hit me with a stick.

1871
01:37:54,090 --> 01:37:58,170
I want someone to hit me
so that my head can break open.

1872
01:37:58,420 --> 01:38:00,840
Then why don't you hit your head
on a wall? Why are you bothering us?

1873
01:38:01,170 --> 01:38:03,090
But be careful,
don't spill any blood on the wall.

1874
01:38:03,590 --> 01:38:05,050
Caution is necessary.

1875
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:06,840
Where's the lunch?

1876
01:38:07,170 --> 01:38:09,590
It's kept over there, there is some
leftover lentils in that as well..

1877
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:24,460
Jinder is so eager to become a citizen.

1878
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:27,090
He was asking money to
give an advance to that girl.

1879
01:38:27,170 --> 01:38:28,130
Who?

1880
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:30,170
Your maestro. Who else?

1881
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:33,590
It is good that I didn't fall for him.

1882
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:36,590
He would've gotten married to me,
become a citizen and then left me.

1883
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:39,800
It's okay. Take a shower.

1884
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:42,960
- I'll serve dinner for you.
- I realised at the right time.

1885
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:44,590
Actually, it's good.

1886
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:54,800
Is this your diary?

1887
01:38:55,380 --> 01:38:56,300
No.

1888
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:00,670
Nindo.

1889
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,840
Looks like a girl's personal diary.

1890
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:04,840
Must be some old tenant's.

1891
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:09,050
This is Jinder's photo.

1892
01:39:11,130 --> 01:39:12,840
Your Jinder!

1893
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:15,380
7838821..

1894
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:22,460
I came to UK from Jalandhar
on a student visa but..

1895
01:39:22,550 --> 01:39:26,090
'..but I couldn't manage to pay the
fees for the third semester..'

1896
01:39:26,170 --> 01:39:29,000
'..so I couldn't neither go back to
the university nor go back to Punjab.'

1897
01:39:29,090 --> 01:39:31,800
'My friend Ruby used to
work at a grocery store.'

1898
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,170
'She got me a job there.'

1899
01:39:33,250 --> 01:39:34,710
'Ruby was born and brought up in UK.'

1900
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,340
'Whenever I used to fumble in English
while dealing with the clients..'

1901
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:39,130
'.. she would handle it.'

1902
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:42,590
'But there was one person
we both couldn't handle.'

1903
01:39:42,670 --> 01:39:44,090
'And that person is Jinder.'

1904
01:39:44,170 --> 01:39:45,960
'Jinder used to work there..'

1905
01:39:46,050 --> 01:39:48,630
'..but even the owner
addressed him with respect.'

1906
01:39:48,670 --> 01:39:49,750
'He is a boy with a very carefree..'

1907
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:52,250
'..devil-may-care attitude
who used to always stay happy.'

1908
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:55,550
'Ruby used to like him but
she was stay to approach him.'

1909
01:39:55,880 --> 01:40:00,500
'One day I told him that
Ruby wants to marry you.'

1910
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,130
Obviously he will say yes.
He is too eager to become a citizen.

1911
01:40:04,710 --> 01:40:07,090
Read on, it's quite interesting.

1912
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,050
Go on.

1913
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:21,340
'Even Ruby was surprised
by what he said.'

1914
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:23,800
'Jinder refused to marry Ruby.'

1915
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:25,880
'And proposed marriage to me instead.'

1916
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:28,000
'What would he gain by marrying me?'

1917
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:30,460
'I wasn't even a citizen. In
fact my visa too was about to expire.'

1918
01:40:30,550 --> 01:40:33,130
'His career would have been
made if he had married Ruby.'

1919
01:40:33,210 --> 01:40:36,880
'But when Jinder said that I don't want
to get married to become a citizen..'

1920
01:40:37,170 --> 01:40:41,840
'..and he also said that you are lucky
that it was love at first sight for me.'

1921
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:44,050
'Jinder has never been in love before.'

1922
01:40:44,130 --> 01:40:46,210
'I too am Punjabi after all.'

1923
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:48,210
'I told him that just because
I am not living with me family..'

1924
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:50,000
'..it doesn't mean that
I don't respect them anymore.'

1925
01:40:50,090 --> 01:40:53,460
'I will marry the boy
of my parents' choice.'

1926
01:40:53,550 --> 01:40:55,800
'He heard that and left.'

1927
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:58,130
'Ruby too said that I am lucky..'

1928
01:40:58,210 --> 01:41:00,920
'..because he wants
to marry me instead of her.'

1929
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,920
'I didn't give her a reply.'

1930
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,840
'And I came home. Next morning,
I got a call from my father.'

1931
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:07,630
'He told me that Jinder's
parents had come..'

1932
01:41:07,710 --> 01:41:09,630
'.. to our house with
his marriage proposal.'

1933
01:41:09,710 --> 01:41:13,710
'They liked his family, and I should let
them know whether I like him as well.'

1934
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:16,090
'Then they would say yes to them.'

1935
01:41:16,170 --> 01:41:18,710
'I said yes.
We started preparing for the wedding.'

1936
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:21,880
'He kept calling and asking
whether or not I am ready.'

1937
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:22,920
"Why should I leave?"

1938
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,670
'I told him to reach with the guests,
I'm coming with Ruby.'

1939
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:30,420
'That day Jinder kept waiting for me,
but I couldn't go there.'

1940
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:34,630
Bal, there's nothing
else written in this.

1941
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:40,170
If Jinder was such a nice boy then why
didn't that crazy girl Nindo come back?

1942
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:45,460
Maybe she didn't write it in the diary.
Maybe she got married.

1943
01:41:45,710 --> 01:41:49,050
If they were married then
why would he want to marry a citizen?

1944
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,920
Moreover, he could have
married Ruby at the first place.

1945
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,670
Now only Nindo can tell us that.
Or Jinder.

1946
01:41:58,380 --> 01:41:59,710
Let me call up Jinder.

1947
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,380
When he hasn't already told you..

1948
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:04,210
..do you think he will tell you
everything over the phone?

1949
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:05,550
You should meet him and talk to him.

1950
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:11,090
What are you doing, father?

1951
01:42:11,590 --> 01:42:12,840
I have work to do.

1952
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:15,380
I need to make preparations
for the wedding.

1953
01:42:15,500 --> 01:42:17,050
I am getting married tonight.

1954
01:42:17,210 --> 01:42:18,800
Yes.
Hello brother, where are you going?

1955
01:42:19,250 --> 01:42:20,130
To work.

1956
01:42:20,210 --> 01:42:21,960
I am getting married today.
Who will give the gifts.

1957
01:42:22,050 --> 01:42:24,960
Let the who looks like
a scraper will give the gifts.

1958
01:42:27,050 --> 01:42:28,840
- Is he calling me a scraper?
- Yes.

1959
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,750
Anyway, it's his wedding today,
you are forgiven.

1960
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,090
- Fine, okay, bye.
- Jinder!

1961
01:42:36,340 --> 01:42:37,460
You are wearing my shoes.

1962
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:39,050
Going to sign again?

1963
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:40,300
They are lucky for me.

1964
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:41,840
Maybe I'll come back because of them.

1965
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:43,750
Uncle, make dinner for me.

1966
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,880
Stupid! We have a wedding
taking place in a house.

1967
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:47,670
We won't be cooking anything today.

1968
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:50,590
We haven't cooked as much
as you seem prepared to hog.

1969
01:42:50,670 --> 01:42:51,630
Why not?

1970
01:42:51,710 --> 01:42:53,750
Who knows whether or not
you'll ever get married for real.

1971
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,590
We should at least
feast on this fake one.

1972
01:42:56,380 --> 01:42:57,460
- Mr. Chaudhary?
- Yes?

1973
01:42:57,550 --> 01:42:58,670
Damn you.

1974
01:42:58,920 --> 01:42:59,800
Fine, okay, bye.

1975
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:01,960
- See you.
- Bye. See you.

1976
01:44:03,550 --> 01:44:06,340
- Date of birth?
- 31st March 1994..

1977
01:44:09,550 --> 01:44:11,500
Balwinder Singh from Taran Taaran?

1978
01:44:15,210 --> 01:44:16,050
Yes.

1979
01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:21,420
John, can you come and
pick up Balwinder Singh?

1980
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:22,800
Take him into custody.

1981
01:45:57,170 --> 01:45:59,670
Oh God! Oh God! Oh God, please!
Please save me this time!

1982
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:01,670
Please save me this time, God!
I don't want to go back.

1983
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:03,800
Please save me this time, God!
Please God!

1984
01:46:04,170 --> 01:46:06,420
I told you, Buta is not a nice man.

1985
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:07,500
He'll get us into trouble.

1986
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:09,710
Otherwise they would never get
hold of the copies of our passports.

1987
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:12,090
Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!
Oh God! Please save me this time, God!

1988
01:46:12,170 --> 01:46:14,840
I don't want to go back.
Please God! Please God! Oh God!

1989
01:46:24,340 --> 01:46:26,170
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

1990
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:27,880
Mother is much better now.

1991
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:29,500
I got her admitted in the morning.

1992
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:31,210
Thank God.

1993
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:32,420
And the money?

1994
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:34,460
The money you sent
in the morning was enough.

1995
01:46:34,550 --> 01:46:36,670
That brother from India is very nice.

1996
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:38,880
He said I should let him know
if I need more money.

1997
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:40,170
He will send it across.

1998
01:46:40,550 --> 01:46:43,340
May God give him a long life.

1999
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:56,050
People already say
that they cannot get along.

2000
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:57,590
They have separated.

2001
01:46:58,590 --> 01:47:01,460
If a partition could separate people..

2002
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:04,840
..then you wouldn't need God
to separate the soul from the body.

2003
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:09,170
You fool, world awaits for an
opportunity for us to make a mistake..

2004
01:47:09,250 --> 01:47:11,090
..so that they can talk against us.

2005
01:47:11,590 --> 01:47:15,170
You have broken our heart
by giving them this opportunity.

2006
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:19,670
We wanted to stay together.

2007
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:22,840
But there are some people
who don't want us together.

2008
01:47:23,170 --> 01:47:24,710
Today you have made them win.

2009
01:47:25,130 --> 01:47:26,840
Then you say that Buta gets cursed.

2010
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:44,800
Jinder, my father will die if I go back.

2011
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:46,550
You don't know how much
money will owe others.

2012
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:50,170
Oh God! Oh God, please!
I don't want to go back. Oh God!

2013
01:47:50,250 --> 01:47:53,500
Please save us, God!
No! I don't want to go back.

2014
01:47:53,590 --> 01:47:54,960
I don't want to go back!

2015
01:47:55,050 --> 01:47:57,630
Jinder, you know we are
here because of our need.

2016
01:47:58,420 --> 01:48:01,210
It's not like we love work in shifts.
Jinder, please save me.

2017
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,340
Save me, please.

2018
01:48:05,090 --> 01:48:06,670
I don't want to go back!

2019
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:09,210
Balwinder Singh!

2020
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:14,050
You have a visitor.
Your fiance is here.

2021
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:30,800
My shoes are indeed quite lucky for you.

2022
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:57,300
Balwinder..

2023
01:49:17,670 --> 01:49:20,670
Your signature. Same here.

2024
01:49:35,590 --> 01:49:37,380
Please do something.

2025
01:49:37,460 --> 01:49:40,550
Sir please, get Jinder out.
Anyhow, please.

2026
01:49:40,630 --> 01:49:41,920
It is difficult to get him.

2027
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,550
You are lucky that you have a fiancÃ©e.

2028
01:49:44,630 --> 01:49:46,300
That's why you are here.

2029
01:51:00,210 --> 01:51:01,210
Thank you.

2030
01:51:02,250 --> 01:51:04,460
Forget thank you,
tell me where is Nindo.

2031
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:05,920
Who is Nindo?

2032
01:51:06,210 --> 01:51:08,590
I have Nindo's diary. I have read it.

2033
01:51:09,050 --> 01:51:10,210
Where is Nindo?

2034
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:13,710
You found that diary now?

2035
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,380
Found that diary now? What do you mean?

2036
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:18,380
I threw it there when you had
just moved into our neighbourhood.

2037
01:51:18,460 --> 01:51:21,250
'Do you only spy on us
or everybody in the locality?'

2038
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:27,460
But when I learnt that you
aren't a citizen I prayed to God..

2039
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,460
..that you shouldn't
ever find the diary.

2040
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:33,500
So all those stories
about Nindo are a lie?

2041
01:51:33,590 --> 01:51:36,550
- Yes.
- So you aren't married?

2042
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:39,500
No. No!

2043
01:51:41,630 --> 01:51:43,750
You were trying to
fool me with a false story?

2044
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:48,000
My story might be a lie
but my love for you is true.

2045
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:51,750
And when did you fall in love with me?
You never told me.

2046
01:51:52,210 --> 01:51:54,000
I too realised it quite late.

2047
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:56,920
You could have told me
when you realised.

2048
01:51:57,300 --> 01:52:00,670
By the time I learnt that I love you,
I also learnt that you are a citizen.

2049
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:05,500
That means you just
realised that you love me?

2050
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:11,340
I feel like getting you arrested again!

2051
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:13,420
Anyway, I got you bailed out.

2052
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:14,960
I have all the papers.

2053
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:18,460
Enjoy today's wedding.
I'll see you later.

2054
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:20,250
Bloody lyricist.

2055
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:45,550
- Oh bless you, brother.
- How are you, uncle?

2056
01:52:45,630 --> 01:52:47,050
- Sorry.
- Good?

2057
01:52:47,130 --> 01:52:48,090
It's okay.

2058
01:52:49,710 --> 01:52:51,590
Brother, how do I thank you enough?

2059
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:54,880
What's the use of such things now?

2060
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:57,380
There is nothing left
to give or take now.

2061
01:52:57,460 --> 01:52:59,340
If you want to thank
someone then thank him.

2062
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:01,250
He has been begging me since morning.

2063
01:53:01,750 --> 01:53:02,840
Buta, my brother.. thank you.

2064
01:53:04,500 --> 01:53:06,300
You forgave me..

2065
01:53:06,550 --> 01:53:09,460
..and thus saved me from
being a culprit of both Punjabs.

2066
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:14,050
We were getting separated
because of my mistake.

2067
01:53:15,420 --> 01:53:17,590
It is not difficult
to separate the Punjabis.

2068
01:53:18,340 --> 01:53:21,500
Instigate us and we
are ready with our sticks.

2069
01:53:24,750 --> 01:53:29,300
But the day these sticks get together
it will be Punjab from Delhi to Kyber.

2070
01:53:39,210 --> 01:53:41,590
Damn you, this isn't a funeral.

2071
01:53:41,670 --> 01:53:45,250
Chaudhary, along with 1000,
we want another 500 bricks.

2072
01:53:45,340 --> 01:53:47,750
500 bricks? You want to build a grave?

2073
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:50,300
Get lost!

2074
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:53,920
Excuse me. Sit over there.

2075
01:53:54,210 --> 01:53:55,840
Sit over there.
I'll handle you two later. Sit down.

2076
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:57,630
Mr. Chaudhary,
are you going to sell your mobile phone?

2077
01:53:59,130 --> 01:54:00,800
- Hello?
- Greetings, father.

2078
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:02,000
Bless you.

2079
01:54:02,090 --> 01:54:04,420
Listen to me..
Are you offering them a free meal?

2080
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:07,670
- Yes, I am.
- You have made us suffer another loss.

2081
01:54:07,750 --> 01:54:09,920
- What happened?
- Listen to me, father..

2082
01:54:10,170 --> 01:54:13,500
- ..take the gifts from all the guests.
- What?

2083
01:54:13,590 --> 01:54:15,090
Take the gifts!

2084
01:54:15,170 --> 01:54:16,420
What happened?

2085
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:19,300
What happened was that
a brother from India's Punjab..

2086
01:54:19,380 --> 01:54:21,340
..who was about to get deported..

2087
01:54:21,590 --> 01:54:23,960
..so I gave your daughter-in-law to him.

2088
01:54:24,050 --> 01:54:25,590
Did you take the money?

2089
01:54:25,670 --> 01:54:28,420
Father, it is not right for me to
ask for money. I address him as brother.

2090
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:29,960
God bless you, my son.

2091
01:54:30,050 --> 01:54:33,460
If you had taken money from
it then I would have broken your bones.

2092
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:36,670
I thought only a few elders
of this side of Punjab..

2093
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:39,000
..still feel the same pull.

2094
01:54:39,090 --> 01:54:41,500
But the sacrifice you
made today made me realise..

2095
01:54:41,880 --> 01:54:45,550
..that the same pull
is still running in our veins.

2096
01:54:45,630 --> 01:54:46,630
Okay, father.

2097
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:48,800
Okay. Father, listen.

2098
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:50,550
The gifts!

2099
01:54:50,630 --> 01:54:54,340
Damn you! It's raining cats and dogs
here. Half the guests didn't show up.

2100
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:59,130
Buta, you have a good heart.
But you look like a thief.

2101
01:55:01,300 --> 01:55:02,500
Thank you, Mr. Chaudhary.

2102
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:09,630
Billa, she got you out
and she can get you back inside.

2103
01:55:09,710 --> 01:55:11,800
Caution is necessary.

2104
01:55:14,380 --> 01:55:15,960
- Buta!
- Yes?

2105
01:55:16,050 --> 01:55:18,710
Damn you. - Same to you.

2106
01:55:23,130 --> 01:55:26,300
- Nikki, how's the tea?
- Lovely, brilliant, man!

2107
01:55:26,380 --> 01:55:28,840
- I like it, it's very milky. Yeah.
- Thank you.

2108
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:31,590
Your kitchen is so messy.

2109
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,920
Our kitchen shines brightly.

2110
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,250
- You are idlers.
- Come on.

2111
01:55:35,340 --> 01:55:37,460
We slog to get paid.
We need to go to work.

2112
01:55:39,420 --> 01:55:42,460
Billa, isn't that Gaffer.

2113
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:46,460
I hate him, Jinder.

2114
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:48,840
He must have not paid so many people!

2115
01:55:48,920 --> 01:55:50,460
I need to make him pay
for all the people he cheated.

2116
01:55:51,750 --> 01:55:54,460
I have all my papers in order now,
with God's grace.

2117
01:55:55,710 --> 01:55:58,550
- You won't back out, will you?
- Go for it.

2118
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:00,380
Go on, my boy!

2119
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:02,300
- See you later.
- Okay, brother!

2120
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:04,420
- Okay.
- Listen, Gaffer.

2121
01:56:05,500 --> 01:56:07,050
- Yes?
- How's life?

2122
01:56:07,130 --> 01:56:08,840
- Same as usual.
- Where to?

2123
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:11,880
- Just...
- Wait, you..

2124
01:56:12,630 --> 01:56:13,340
Oh damn!

2125
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:47,710
"I have just one desire.."

2126
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:53,340
"My in-laws should stay in a village."

2127
01:56:53,420 --> 01:56:56,250
"Then even the wind will sing songs."

2128
01:56:56,340 --> 01:56:59,090
"Then even the wind will sing songs."

2129
01:56:59,170 --> 01:57:02,170
"Then even the wind will sing songs.."

2130
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:05,460
"When I will get married to you."

2131
01:57:05,550 --> 01:57:07,750
"Even the clouds.."

2132
01:57:08,250 --> 01:57:11,050
"Even the clouds will feel jealous.."

2133
01:57:11,130 --> 01:57:13,960
"..when we will get married
during the monsoons."

2134
01:57:14,340 --> 01:57:16,920
"Even the clouds will feel jealous.."

2135
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,250
"..when we will get married
during the monsoons."

2136
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:24,000
"Even the clouds.."

2137
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:49,670
"They must have made good
arrangements for all the guests."

2138
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:52,710
"We will leave with the
bride in the evening, I guess."

2139
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:55,670
"We will leave with the
bride in the evening, I guess."

2140
01:57:55,750 --> 01:57:58,630
"They must have made
good arrangements.."

2141
01:57:58,710 --> 01:58:01,460
For all the guests."

2142
01:58:01,550 --> 01:58:04,250
"We will leave with the bride .."

2143
01:58:04,340 --> 01:58:07,050
"In the evening, I guess."

2144
01:58:07,130 --> 01:58:10,460
"My parents will cry."

2145
01:58:10,550 --> 01:58:13,000
"My parents will cry."

2146
01:58:13,090 --> 01:58:16,000
"My parents will cry.."

2147
01:58:16,130 --> 01:58:19,250
"When I will touch their
feet and leave with you."

2148
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:22,090
"Even the clouds.."

2149
01:58:22,170 --> 01:58:24,840
"Even the clouds will feel jealous.."

2150
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:28,130
"..when we will get married
during the monsoons."

2151
01:58:28,210 --> 01:58:30,800
"Even the clouds will feel jealous.."

2152
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:34,050
"..when we will get married
during the monsoons."

2153
01:58:34,130 --> 01:58:37,130
"Even the clouds.."

2154
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:51,800
"You my beloved are
bright like the wheat."

2155
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:54,960
"You my sweetheart
