00:00:03,463 --> 00:00:05,600
 Mumbai - The Heart of India. 

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,815
 This heart of India has faced many attacks. 

3
00:00:09,649 --> 00:00:12,940
 The first attack - 1993 serial blasts. 

4
00:00:13,107 --> 00:00:14,607
 Followed by - 2002 bus blast. 

5
00:00:14,857 --> 00:00:16,149
 2006 train blast. 

6
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:18,878
 And 2008 Taj 26/11. 

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,914
 But the biggest attack on Mumbai was yet to happen. 

8
00:00:25,713 --> 00:00:27,649
 The responsibility to stop this attack was on the shoulders of ... 

9
00:00:27,729 --> 00:00:30,207
 ... Mumbai's Anti-Terrorism Squad warrior: 

10
00:00:32,107 --> 00:00:34,065
 "Sooryavanshi." 

11
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:40,732
 Mumbai Police doesn't check your Religion on your passport before shooting 

12
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:43,274
 ... but looks at criminal records before gunning you down 

13
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:48,681
 I've been shot. 

14
00:00:54,417 --> 00:00:55,440
 "Sooryavanshi." 

15
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,413
 According to our intelligence, there are 40 more like you ... 

16
00:00:58,493 --> 00:01:02,940
 ... who have been living in India for the last few years as Lashkar's sleeper cell. 

17
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,643
 Their time has come yet. 

18
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:09,107
 But when it does, you won't have to go looking for them. 

19
00:01:09,255 --> 00:01:10,054
 We've found you. 

20
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:11,894
 We'll find your comrades as well. 

21
00:01:20,425 --> 00:01:23,511
 In '93, one tonne of RDX was brought into India. 

22
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:27,745
 Out of which only 400 kilos were used. And it brought Mumbai to its knees. 

23
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:32,734
 600 kilos is still buried somewhere in the country. 

24
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,015
 India changed my fate. 

25
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:48,267
 And now I will change India's fate. 

26
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,149
 My kids, my wife, my father they were all burnt alive. 

27
00:01:58,274 --> 00:02:00,482
 I agree, that whatever happened to you was wrong. 

28
00:02:00,624 --> 00:02:03,524
 But what about the thousands of innocent lives you took? 

29
00:02:03,604 --> 00:02:04,870
 Stay back! 

30
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,591
 Other police officers in the city are also doing their duty. 

31
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:15,500
 But no one would risk his own child to do their duty. 

32
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:19,870
 I think the Intelligence Bureau's theory is correct. 

33
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,078
 Lashkar's next target will be Mumbai. 

34
00:02:24,024 --> 00:02:27,512
 Soorya, I don't know when they will come, but I'm sure that they will 

35
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:29,107
 Let them come ... 

36
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:33,426
 ... this time we'll be ready. 

37
00:02:41,403 --> 00:02:42,940
 What do we do, sir? Leave for Shivgadh? 

38
00:02:43,116 --> 00:02:45,108
 Only one scoundrel can do this job. 

39
00:02:49,024 --> 00:02:51,086
 There is some high level plotting happening here, sir. 

40
00:02:56,232 --> 00:02:59,107
 They have planted bombs in seven cars. 

41
00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:05,299
 "Sooryavanshi." 

42
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:12,457
 The bullet that kills you, will read in bold 'Made In India' 

43
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:20,440
 Everyone in the audience knows who is about to make an entrance ... 

44
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:21,501
 And you don't? 

45
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:23,453
 "The heart races." "The body trembles." 

46
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:26,440
 "When you know he's coming." "Singham." 

47
00:03:26,546 --> 00:03:28,182
 Why do you always have to do stunts with your cars? 

48
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:30,024
 Why do you always hang off a helicopter? 

49
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:30,690
 Right. 

50
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,008
 So who's got a bigger ... Entry. 

51
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,274
 It doesn't matter. Let's go. 

52
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:35,921
 "Sooryavanshi." 

53
00:03:40,963 --> 00:03:42,512
 "Sooryavanshi." 

54
00:03:50,307 --> 00:03:52,107
 Do you know who this is? Naem Khan. 

55
00:03:52,187 --> 00:03:54,565
 He has been an honest police officer for 30 years. 

56
00:03:54,645 --> 00:03:59,357
 And now, his son Abbas is a capable officer of our Anti Terrorist Squad. 

57
00:03:59,518 --> 00:04:01,616
 These are the Muslims of India. 

58
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,153
 "Police is here."
